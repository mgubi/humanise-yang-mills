# Build record: OpenAI-YM-20261028

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source | `https://github.com/yang-mills-group/OpenAI-YM-20261028` |
| Revision | `3456e5e75cf8d4cd558955a5c7638fba2d68f464` |
| Toolchain | `leanprover/lean4:v4.32.0` |
| Audit date | 11 November 2026 |
| Status | **Pinned build commands passed from a verified prebuilt artifact; no clean source rebuild was performed on this host. A clean from-source rebuild on a separate Linux host passed on 12 November 2026: see the addendum below** |

## Result

The upstream default-target command

```sh
cd Lean
lake build WilsonReference WilsonConstruction
```

exited successfully with `Build completed successfully (18126 jobs).` in 11.01
seconds. The stricter check

```sh
lake build --no-build WilsonReference WilsonConstruction
```

also exited successfully, with `All targets up-to-date (18126 jobs).`, in 8.65
seconds. Thus the restored artifact contained every required job and the ordinary
build did not hide a missing artifact by compiling it during the audit.

This is not a clean build from source on the audit host. It verifies the build
graph and artifacts restored from Scott Armstrong's
[compiled Lean release](https://github.com/scottnarmstrong/yang-mills-informalization/releases/tag/lean-build-3456e5e).
The release is for the pinned source revision and was produced on Linux x86-64;
the checks below were run after restoring it on Apple Silicon macOS. The combined
archive had SHA-256 digest
`07c145c36a45948ac55044a98d5626c201fe7ad6214d627a0739694c8e464707`,
matching its published checksum. It is retained only in the machine-local shared
cache and has not been added to Git.

The source distribution's own integrity check had previously passed:

```sh
cd Lean
shasum -a 256 -c SOURCES.sha256
```

All 9,507 listed files reported `OK`. This checks the imported files against the
distribution's manifest; it does not independently authenticate the manifest or
establish a Lean proof.

## Environment

| Component | Audited value |
| --- | --- |
| Host | `Darwin 27.3.0`, `arm64`, macOS 27.3 build `26C5035r` |
| Lean | `4.32.0`, commit `8c9756b28d64dab099da31a4c09229a9e6a2ef35`, `arm64-apple-darwin24.6.0` |
| Lake | `5.0.0-src+8c9756b` |
| `Lean/lean-toolchain` SHA-256 | `2773c517aa90b66ea8a2c52bddddf84393157797f8341be0df45294fff7fd32e` |
| `Lean/lake-manifest.json` SHA-256 | `389c72d12e69c19b8a699df76405b2b1538f8f46ae77837fd2e972dda52724c3` |

The commands used the pinned toolchain directory first on `PATH` so that
Mathlib's cache helper could find the matching `leantar` executable:

```sh
env PATH=/Users/hairer/.elan/toolchains/leanprover--lean4---v4.32.0/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin COMMAND
```

## Commands and outcomes

| Command, from `Lean/` unless noted | Result | Wall time |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `lake exe cache get` | Pass; timed recheck found 8,639 files already decompressed and no download required | 6.59 s |
| `lake unpack /Users/hairer/.local/share/humanise-yang-mills/lean-build-3456e5e/ym-build-3456e5e.tgz` | Pass; restored `.lake/build` | 29.39 s observed by the command runner |
| `lake build --no-build WilsonReference WilsonConstruction` | Pass; all 18,126 jobs up to date | 8.65 s |
| `lake build WilsonReference WilsonConstruction` | Pass; 18,126 jobs | 11.01 s |
| `lake env lean -j1 -DmaxHeartbeats=0 -DmaxRecDepth=4096 VerifyJoint.lean` | Pass; type match, 17 endpoint axiom checks, and kernel replay | 828.66 s |
| Temporary-overlay run of `verification/Usage.lean` | Pass; 17 roots, 250,319 project declarations | 104.49 s |
| `lake env lean ... verification/Inventory.lean`, before building aggregate root | Fail; `YM.olean` was absent from the release artifact | 2.95 s |
| `lake build YM` | Pass; built the one missing aggregate root from existing modules | 38.21 s |
| `lake env lean ... verification/Inventory.lean`, second run | Pass; 249,713 `YM` declarations, no direct placeholder or project axiom | 36.66 s |

The first `Inventory.lean` failure is retained because it describes the exact
coverage of the downloaded artifact. It was not a source or proof failure. The
aggregate `YM` root is outside the two advertised default build targets, and its
single missing object was produced without changing `Lean/` sources.

Detailed axiom evidence is in
[`evidence/axioms-3456e5e.md`](evidence/axioms-3456e5e.md), and inventory evidence
is in [`evidence/usage-3456e5e.md`](evidence/usage-3456e5e.md).

## Retained logs

Raw logs are retained locally under the ignored directory
`Lean/.lake/audit-issue2/`; they are not committed or uploaded. Their SHA-256
digests are:

The linked release and its recorded checksum identify the retained build artifact.
A reviewer can reproduce the compact evidence files from it without obtaining
these local logs.

## Limitations

- The successful commands do not independently establish the intended physical
  interpretation or adequacy of any theorem statement.
- This run trusts the pinned Lean executable, kernel implementation, and pinned
  external package artifacts. The project replay checks proof terms against that
  kernel; it is not a diverse implementation check.
- The audit used a third-party prebuilt project artifact rather than deleting all
  objects and recompiling every source file on this host. The `--no-build` pass
  establishes artifact completeness relative to Lake's recorded build traces.
- Existing linter and axiom-information messages were replayed during the build.
  They did not cause failure. The deliberate reference placeholder in
  `Challenge.lean` is accounted for in the axiom evidence.

## Addendum: clean from-source rebuild (issue #37)

On 12 November 2026 every project module was compiled from source on an
independent Linux x86-64 host, from an empty project build directory and without
the prebuilt artifact, and the upstream verification commands were repeated.
All passed with the same job count, replay counts, endpoint axioms and inventory
counts as recorded above. The record is
[`evidence/clean-build-3456e5e.md`](evidence/clean-build-3456e5e.md). This closes
the third limitation above for the project's own modules; Mathlib and the other
external packages still come from their pinned caches. Two observations from
that record qualify statements in this file:

- In the Git import, `shasum -a 256 -c SOURCES.sha256` reports 9,497 files `OK`
  and 10 absent (the ten `verification/*.log` files of the manifest, which are
  not tracked). The "all 9,507 listed files" result above describes the original
  archive.
- The prebuilt artifact's generated C and `.ilean` files are byte-identical to
  the fresh build, and 8,426 of its 9,470 `.olean` files as well. The other 1,044
  differ only through the absolute source path stored with persisted linter
  messages: recompiled under a root path of the same length, all 1,044 equal the
  artifact's files after substituting that path.
