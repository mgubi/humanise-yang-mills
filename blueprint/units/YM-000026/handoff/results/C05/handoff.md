# C05 author handoff

Session `ADB991-claude-20261112-0c65`. Branch `ADB991:claude/issue-46-0c65`, based on
`codex/existence-monograph` at `01ef22c`. Final hashes are in `validation.md`.

## Established (author check, not yet independently reviewed)

- All 14 C05 chapters were read in full and their proved steps re-verified (list in
  `findings.md`). No mathematical error was found in the proved steps.
- The OPE chain inside C05 is now explicit end to end. It runs from the reference
  cone, difference and match, through the cutoff price, `prop:ope-match-assembly`,
  `input:ope-match`, `ope-grid` and `input:ope-raw-estimates`, to
  `thm:ope-quantitative`. It uses **one** finite-cutoff label `Q_n` per sequence index,
  the same fixed-m quota, the marked grids, interpolation, and the continuum
  remainder. No subpower claim is made for `Q_n`: the whole-label bound is `‖Q_n‖ ≤ J_n V_n` with upper rates `qa` and `τ−qa`, hence upper rate `τ` (no exact rate; `Q_n` may vanish). [Corrected in revision 2; the first version wrongly said rate `qa`.]
  The scale-letter swap between the reference chapters and the cutoff accounting is
  written out and checked against Lean `YM.OPE.funding` and `YM.OPE.terminalAfford`.
- Matched producer statements: C06 `eq:leaf-projection-allowance` →
  `eq:ope-leaf-projection` (x = Q_e); C16 `ope-history-service` local price s_m → Γ;
  C16 (O1) → cover-rate condition.

## Not established

- Every incoming edge in `ledger.md` other than the three above is open or needs the
  producer's acknowledgement. In particular, these producers were not located (F2):
  the signed reference transitions, the terminal reference identification, the
  triangular column estimates, the local trial comparison, the analytic
  marked-representation estimates and the dictionary slot property. The OPE theorem
  is therefore still **conditional**.
- C14 must state its vanishing-test conclusion for subpower families (F1).
- C16 `assembly.tex` should cite `thm:ope-quantitative` and carry its conditional
  status (F3).
- O(4) action on field levels: no producer, and C05 is a consumer, not the producer
  (F5).
- No Lean elaboration or axiom replay was possible here.

## Next steps

1. **Independent C05 review** (a different agent or person): mathematics and Lean
   correspondence of the five changed chapters at the final hashes. The new
   `prop:ope-match-assembly` and the dictionary table in `ope-cutoff.tex` are the
   substantive additions to check. Reviewer output goes in `results/C05/review/`.
2. C14, C16, C03 and C06 authors: acknowledge or correct the edges named in
   `ledger.md` in your own ledgers.
3. G06: assign owners for F2(a)–(f) and F5.
4. G05: notation reuse noted in F6 and F7 (no prose change made for these).

Metadata additions for the eventual integrator: none required. The changed files
remain within canonical unit `YM-000026`, whose `manuscript` list already includes
them; no new proof unit was created.
