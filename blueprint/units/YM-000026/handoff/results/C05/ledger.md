# C05 input/output ledger (author side)

Session `ADB991-claude-20261112-0c65`, source pin `3456e5e`, start `01ef22c`.
Status vocabulary: **matched** = the author has checked that the producer's
displayed statement supplies the consumer's exact statement and common data.
That is still one-sided, and the producer and an independent reviewer must
acknowledge it. **interface** = a producer exists but a restatement or
acknowledgement is needed. **open** = no producer located, or not compared.
**internal** = a C05 output used by another C05 chapter, checked here.

Common data for every edge unless stated otherwise: one selected history (C16
`sec:ope-history-service`, support exponent 100), one ordered cutoff filter (period,
then mesh), field levels `E_n` with injective physical inclusions, and the fixed
prescription `(u_α, b_α)` of `prop:ope-prescription`.

## Outputs of C05

| Output | Statement (hypotheses → conclusion) | Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prop:ope-prescription` | Separating exterior tests on finite-dim `E_n` with compatible inclusions → one system `u_α, b_α`, biorthogonal and reconstructing at every degree, with `b_{α,m}=0` for `m<|α|` | `ope-homogeneous`, `ope-grid`, `ope-estimates` (internal) |

## Internal chain (checked in this pass)

`sec:reference-cone` → `sec:reference-difference` → `sec:reference-match` →
`eq:ope-cutoff-discrepancy` (R1 dictionary) → `prop:ope-match-assembly` (+
`sec:ope-phase-prices`, `sec:ope-filtration`) → `input:ope-match` → `ope-grid`
(reading, remainder, interpolation; also needs F4) → `input:ope-raw-estimates` →
`ope-estimates` → `thm:ope-quantitative`. Each arrow is checked except where
another edge below is named. The chain is conditional on all incoming edges.

## Incoming edges

| Edge ID | Producer → C05 consumer | Exact statement needed | Status |

| C02-to-C05-centered | C02 `centered-estimates.tex` (`ex-centered-estimates`), `centered-construction.tex` (`ex-centered-sail`) → `ope-phase-prices`, `reference-match` | Planted inequality; change-of-cell root estimate; centered price `(1+C)a_k^{-d-ε}+1`, uniform in period/labels after the reference depth; complete-moment bound `exp(|Λ_m|𝒱_m+5M)` with singleton allowances 2, 1 | open (not compared in this pass) |
| C06-to-C05-leaf-projection | C06 `leaf-transfer.tex` `eq:leaf-projection-allowance` → `eq:ope-leaf-projection` | `dens(Q)=L^d𝒯 dens(M)`, coefficient and remainder `≤x cost(M)`; fine expansion `2cost`, response `x cost`, multiplier `L^d` | matched (R5), with `x=Q_e`, `cost=m`; conditional on C06's localized-expansion, tail, flag and smallness inputs |

| C14-to-C05-null-projections | C14 `finite-rank-kernel-transport.tex` → `ope-filtration` `eq:ope-test-kernel`, vanishing-test input | `p_c→p` with `ker p=⋂ker f_θ`; kernel families of **subpower** bare norm have vanishing tests | interface (F1): `p_c=A_c`, `p=T`; C14 displays the bounded form only |
| C13-to-C05-local-trials | C13 (per known-open-edges; source `YM.MergeProof.onions`) → `ope-filtration` | Degree-e labels `u_c` with subpower bare norm whose centered price difference from the local trial tends to 0, at purchased cutoff-dependent derivative orders and thresholds, same filter; trial definition now names locality on a fixed stencil, literal translation, eventual continuity, sup price and derivative price on healthy configurations (`RawProtected`, `Stencilled`, `supBounds`) | open (F2d); conditional candidate C14 `actual-insertion-derivative-relay.tex` (reported by reviewer, not verified) |

## Outgoing edge requiring the consumer's action

| Edge ID | C05 producer → consumer | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C05-to-C16-ope-endpoint | `thm:ope-quantitative` → C16 `assembly.tex` `ex-ope-coefficient`, `ex-ope-remainder` | Statements match (F3). The consumer should cite the theorem and carry its conditional status |
| C05-to-C14-column-subpower | `ex-column-subpower`, `eq:ope-bounded-bare` → C14 | Supplies "bounded ⇒ subpower inverse-calibrated" as C14 uses it |
| C05-to-C15-reference | `eq:reference-gain`, `eq:reference-produced-difference` → C15 | Unchanged statements; C15 should reuse them at the same constants |
