# C10: higher stationary response, annular terms and inherited loops (author pass)

- Package: C10, issue [#51](https://github.com/hairer/humanise-yang-mills/issues/51); parent #26. Unit YM-000026.
- Session: `schmittj-claude-c10-20261112`, role AUTHOR. Method: four read-only Codex `gpt-6-astra` audit passes over all seventeen chapters; two Claude author agents on disjoint chapter sets, who decided every audit item against the LaTeX and the Lean text and made the repairs (part A: `soft-curvature-receipts`, `multileg-curvature-lift`, `weighted-frame-penalty`, `weighted-stationary-inverses`, `selected-stationary-linear-data`, `selected-kinetic-response`, `stationary-determinant-prices`, `thermal-contact-cancellation`; part B: `classical-stationary-vertices`, `annulus-fleet-face-estimates`, `annulus-two-wave-estimates`, `annulus-recording-yield`, `annulus-same-data-binding`, `stationary-germ-symmetry`, `stationary-output-construction`, `inherited-loop-transport`, `quadratic-pole-transport`); then a second Codex pass over every edited hunk, whose findings and the authors' responses are recorded in each part's `findings.md` under "Second round". Coordinated by a Claude session. None of this is an independent review.
- Status: **author draft, not reviewed.** No approval is recorded. An independent reviewer owns `review/`.
- Base: `codex/existence-monograph` at `80be46a`, rebased onto `81538d6`. Source pin `3456e5e75cf8d4cd558955a5c7638fba2d68f464`. Lean was read as text only; nothing was elaborated.

## Where things are

`part-A/` and `part-B/` each contain `findings.md` (errors repaired, gaps repaired, gaps not repaired, the table "Audit items and decisions", second-round responses, notes for other packages), `ledger.md`, `correspondence.md` and `validation.md`. `handoff.md` in this directory is the summary for the reviewer and for G06.

## Summary of the pass

Sixteen of the seventeen chapters changed; `multileg-curvature-lift.tex` was checked against the Lean statements and left as it was. Main repairs:

1. `classical-stationary-vertices.tex`: the contraction formula inverted the raw internal Hessian, which is degenerate under gauge transformations; the source inverts its gauge completion. The text now has \(Hu=-s\) and \(HM^{-1}H=H\) with proof; the final formulas are unchanged. New `prop:ex-classical-stationary-pictures`.
2. `annulus-fleet-face-estimates.tex`: the geometric hypothesis was too weak for the lower bound on the denominator (new hypothesis and proof); the regulator is built from the ghost film, not the Wilson film; the input family is now defined; the three contributions after summing over plaquette types are displayed.
3. `annulus-two-wave-estimates.tex`, `annulus-recording-yield.tex`, `annulus-same-data-binding.tex`: the recording strip is chosen after \(L\), not before; a missing radial integration is supplied; `lem:ex-annulus-common-strip` replaces a one-line justification; `prop:ex-annulus-estimate` states the annulus estimate (the source's `HorizCalc`), conditional on two named inputs.
4. `soft-curvature-receipts.tex`: a wrong restriction removed; the Ward-partition proof rewritten with the period-independent block functions; definitions of the actions, the bed and its attachment and the floor clauses; `lem:ex-soft-quadratic-hessian` and `lem:ex-soft-wilson-pictures`; the recording statements carry the entrywise summability that the source requires.
5. `stationary-determinant-prices.tex`: a bound on the complex strip was false as stated (\(\le5h\), not \(\le h\)). `weighted-stationary-inverses.tex`: a positivity hypothesis added. `selected-stationary-linear-data.tex`: the tangent identity is an explicit named input from C11, not proved here.
6. `stationary-output-construction.tex`, `inherited-loop-transport.tex`, `quadratic-pole-transport.tex`: a missing direct Wilson term; the matching equations are inputs, not consequences of stationarity; a guard that restricts \(L\); new `prop:stationary-output-path`, `prop:inherited-loop-picture`, `prop:ex-pole-coefficient-transport`.

The second Codex pass found one regression, two errors and two gaps in the first-round edits. All were confirmed against the source and corrected; they are listed with the corrections in the findings files. No edit had to be reverted to the original text.

## Edges to C11

- `C10-to-C11-annulus-estimate`: produced as `prop:ex-annulus-estimate`, conditional on the inputs (W), (S) and the fixed-film ticket input (T) named there (the last is the edge `unassigned-to-C10-film-tickets`).
- `C10-to-C11-one-step`: C10 does not state the assembled one-step theorem. C11's interface in the source uses a refinement that C10 does not state; the four components in part B are now explicit propositions.
- `C10-to-C11-hessian-identity`: only the flat-coordinate Hessian is proved here; the forest chart with penalty and the chart analyticity are produced by no C10 chapter.
- `C11-to-C10-stationary-tangent`: consumed as a named input.

## What is not done

- Inputs stated explicitly and not produced by any located chapter: the conversion from Taylor pictures to marked-layer responses with fees (inputs (W), (S) of the annulus estimate); the recording of the film slots at every torus side (`unassigned-to-C10-film-tickets`); a uniform gap over all periods for the classical and output chapters; same-history path and bed data.
- The all-period extension of one soft-receipt statement is not written; the theorem stays at what the source exports.
- Incoming edges from C01 (rack legs, two-scale matching), C06, C07, C09 and C11 were opened only at the cited passages.
- Declarations not opened are listed in the findings files.
- Three new propositions list only the hypotheses their arguments use, while the Lean lemmas take packaged data with further fields; this is stated in the text and should be confirmed by the reviewer.

## Validation

- Full build after the rebase: `latexmk -cd -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error -outdir=<scratch> existence.tex` from `manuscript/`: exit 0, 938 pages, no undefined references, no multiply defined labels, no overfull boxes.
- Scoped wrappers for each part were built and changed pages inspected as images (lists in the part `validation.md` files; not every changed page was viewed).
- `python3 scripts/check_blueprint.py`: `Blueprint structure OK: 4 units.` `git diff --check`: clean.
- New labels are listed in the part validation files. No existing label was removed or renamed.

## Revision 1 (13 November 2026)

Answering finding R1 of the review in `review/mgubi-codex-c10-annulus-20261113/` (draft PR #99): the fixed-film ticket calculus was an explicit input in the text but was missing from the statement of `prop:ex-annulus-estimate`, from the dependency summary after it and from the outgoing edge to C11. It is now named (T) in `annulus-same-data-binding.tex`, is a hypothesis of the proposition next to (W) and (S), appears in the summary, and the edge `C10-to-C11-annulus-estimate` and `handoff.md` carry it. Only `annulus-same-data-binding.tex` changed among the chapters; its new SHA-256 is recorded in `part-B/validation.md`. The hash table above gives the hashes at the first handoff. The reviewed hashes of that chapter are stale and need renewed review.

## Revision 2 (13 November 2026)

Session `schmittj-claude-c10-rev2-20261113`, answering finding G04-F1 of the G04 author pass (PR #119; note on issue #60 of 13 November). Only `annulus-two-wave-estimates.tex` changed; its SHA-256 is now `1d7c80972d3ac8d5d967b046a0c0e9f74e89e5d13ce82f6e2dabeefbbe0e6ea0`.

The chapter defined \(C_G\) through "the chosen invariant inner product" without naming it. It now states that this is the colour inner product \(\langle u,v\rangle=-r_G^{-1}\operatorname{Re}\operatorname{tr}(uv)\), that the colour basis is orthonormal for it, and gives \(C_G=-(\dim\mathfrak g)^{-1}\sum_b\operatorname{tr}((\operatorname{ad}e_b)^2)\), with the value \(2N^2\) for \(SU(N)\) as orientation. Source read for this: `YM.Gauge.trace_color` (`Lean/YM/Gauge/Colors.lean`: \(-\operatorname{Re}\operatorname{tr}(\texttt{colorMat}\,c\cdot\texttt{colorMat}\,d)=r_G\langle c,d\rangle\)), `YM.Gauge.casimir` (same file, defined with the standard orthonormal basis of the colour space), `YM.Gauge.trace_adjoint` (`Lean/YM/Gauge/Casimir.lean`), `YM.Gauge.slopeConstant` \(=11\,\texttt{casimir}/(24\pi^2)\). Consequently \(C_G\) of this chapter is `casimir`, it equals \(C_{\mathfrak g}\) of the running-coefficient unit YM-000022, and \(\lambda_G=11C_G/(24\pi^2)\) is `slopeConstant` \(=2b_0(G)\). The value for \(SU(N)\) is the author's computation from the Killing form \(2N\operatorname{tr}(uv)\).

Not settled here: the positive constant \(s_G\) in `common-scale-selection.tex` (package C16) is introduced there only as "\(s_G>0\)"; whether it is `slopeConstant` was not checked. That is the remaining half of G04-F1 and belongs to C16.

No statement or estimate changed. Validation: full `latexmk` build of `manuscript/existence.tex` on base `ce1b3a4` with this edit, exit 0, 966 pages, 0 undefined references, 0 overfull boxes. Not independently reviewed.
