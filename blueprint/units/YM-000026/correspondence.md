## Mathematical scope and inputs

This work responds to the request for the entire existence argument and remains in progress. The manuscript now proves finite Wilson foundations, scalar rate control, conditional flat-step transport, ordered extraction, all-mesh smooth convergence from explicit finite-difference/Cauchy inputs, reflection-positive dynamics, ground-algebra disintegration, conditional phase selection and regularity, null-retention criteria, complex heat time, joint tempered boundary values, mixed heat-vector Gram limits, and common-domain field reconstruction. The subsequent chapters prove Fourier support, Lorentz covariance, full-tube continuation, locality, field detection and joint momentum positivity from the displayed earlier inputs, following the main Lean steps. These proofs discharge former reconstruction interface assumptions but do not yet establish the actual RG, calibration, ultraviolet or OPE/trace estimates. The final conditional assembly is not the complete existence proof.

The shared [glossary](../../glossary.md) and [notation protocol](../../../docs/notation.md) determine the main conventions. `G` is the fixed closed subgroup of `U(r_G)`; `P_p` is the physical period, `D_N` the denominator, `a_N=D_N^{-1}`, and the site count per axis is `P_p D_N`. The finite link action is `S_ell`, and continuum correlations use `S` with insertion/phase indices. The extraction section declares its own correlation notation and generic domains. The reflection section uses an inner product conjugate-linear in its first argument. The selected phase is distinct from the mixed hierarchy throughout.

The existing [YM-000022](../YM-000022/correspondence.md) proves running-coefficient asymptotic extraction from an explicit running estimate. This article does not duplicate that proof or assert that the underlying running estimate has been established by either unit.

The finite-measure and Hilbert-space arguments are reorganized in ordinary mathematics. Quotienting by null vectors then completing is equivalent to the source's separated seminormed completion. The full-mesh lemma isolates uniqueness of complex limits from the larger `Spec.Final` package. The final assembly specializes the blocking penalty to 1 and the initial mesh order to the identity; it preserves the same family and hierarchy in all four endpoint properties.

## Literature and editorial decisions

Scott Armstrong's source-cluster map at `8f3c7ccaeabb17b0f928bc1a2e75328691de3032`, credited in the repository's [outline](../../outline.md), was used for navigation only. The parent read the live [#11 audit / PR #18](https://github.com/hairer/humanise-yang-mills/pull/18) and rechecked the meaning-determining source. Its files and existing literature task outputs were not edited.

The parent inspected the original Osterwalder–Schrader 1975 paper, *Communications in Mathematical Physics* 42, 281–305, [PDF](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/communications-in-mathematical-physics/volume-42/issue-3/Axioms-for-Euclidean-Greens-functions-II-with-an-Appendix-by/cmp/1103899050.pdf), introduction and §IV.1, pp. 287–288. The corrected sufficient theorem requires growth control in addition to the Euclidean axioms. The manuscript cites it only as a possible route with outstanding hypothesis checks. In particular `Table.Capped` allows constants depending on each fixed label tuple and arity; it is not by itself a checked match for the paper's arity-growth condition. The reviewer could not independently retrieve the PDF and does not certify its application. No claim is made to have completed the separately owned literature task #6.

The finite Wilson proofs use elementary matrix algebra, compactness and probability Haar invariance. The lattice drafter's Wilson-paper search did not obtain a verified substitute for any RG estimate. Source constructor names, bookkeeping, and undefined estimate norms have been removed from the mathematical narrative; their substantive unproved content remains in the evidence and obligations below.

## Outstanding proof obligations

| Obligation | Exact boundary already identified | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Select the same actual Wilson trajectory with quantitative estimates | `YM.Independent.constructionRun`; native component recipes; `YM.RG08.Flat.entrance_gate` | Not proved in prose; selector packaging cannot replace estimates |
| Compactness estimates for the actual correlations | `YM.Extraction.TransferLip`, `YM.Extraction.Bound`; producers from `C.Makes` and `YM.Extraction.CenteredBook` | Exact input identified; RG derivation outstanding |
| Extend generic extraction to all required separated tests and Euclidean properties | domination near coordinate ties, basis-label extension, smoothness and `S.Capped`, finite reflection positivity | Only arguments with explicitly stated hypotheses may be used; source-specific verification still required |
| Full mesh convergence | `YM.FullVolume.PositionsUV C .full` | Local finite-difference Taylor argument and dense Cauchy criterion give full smooth convergence; actual FixedBounds and Purchased production remain |
| Phase representation and selected vacuum | `YM.OS.Selection.Certificate`, `YM.Spec.Final.phase` | Ground algebra, measure, a.e. heat uniqueness, phase caps/regularity and reflection transport proved from displayed inputs; actual all-copy/slab, approximation and detector estimates remain |
| Relativistic continuation and fields | `YM.Spec.Relativistic`, `YM.Boundary.Wightman.Realizes`, `YM.EveryPhase.Completed` | Complex heat, strict-time continuation, full ordered-height tempered boundary, independent heat Gram limit and field domain proved from slab data. Lorentz covariance, full tube, locality, boundary label detection and joint momentum PVM are now proved from their explicit earlier inputs; the quotient-to-Lorentz-action descent is also proved, while actual slab, phase-null and calibration production remain |
| OPE and trace/nonfree requirements | `Headline.SeparatedOPE`, `Headline.TraceExclusions`, public bridges | Finite compatible prescription, rotation/reality averaging, homogeneous decomposition and conditional quantitative OPE transfer are proved. Single-field positive spectral measure, finite Wick-profile expansions, logarithmic exclusion and conditional trace asymptotic are proved. Actual raw OPE estimates, calibrated stress/Ward and ultraviolet scale inputs remain outstanding |
| Interpret constructed observables physically | actual calibrated local insertions and internal stress trace | Public token flexibility does not identify arbitrary prescribed observables; no stronger physical interpretation asserted |

These are gaps in this exposition, not findings of a contradiction in the Lean source. The independent scope review found no concrete vacuity within its bounded inspection. The pinned build/axiom evidence is inherited from [source/build.md](../../../source/build.md), with its prebuilt-artifact limitation; it is not an audit of this English argument.

A guessed `YM/Euclid/Conditions.lean` path did not exist; the actual definition was located in `Table.lean`.
- No Lean source, toolchain or dependency was changed. No fresh Lean build, axiom replay or standalone proof verification was performed.
- Integration checks and rendered-output evidence are recorded in `validation.md` after they are actually run.

All formal review approvals remain null. Agent reviews are evidence and error discovery, not human acceptance of the full construction.

### Public centered supplier correction

The actual selected-run centered bound is supplied by `YM.MergeProof.Accent.gardena` via `Run.again`, `FullVolume.ahead`, `Unlatched.rampant`, and `Hearth.hearthstone` (qualified source crosswalk in the in-progress centered-construction evidence). The previously reviewed density/lane conversion is an alternative Multi route, now excluded from the main article. Its `Offer`/`Thick` assumptions must not be promoted to public endpoint assumptions or described as an axiom gap. The actual marked-copy/served-slab proof is being expanded and independently reviewed before integration.

### Continuation and delivery instruction
Maintainer explicitly requested in chat that all completed work be pushed to the repository once done, and reiterated that the task must not finish before the whole proof is complete. No completion or accepted-proof claim is attached to current local conditional passes. Remaining analytic producers are continuing work.

New local units: `sec:ope-singletons` (North/Arbor and Frost), `sec:local-transfer` (Temper.Duty.pre / Copse.stroke), `sec:ope-local-projection` (Shasta.tossing / Lamplit.fuseNext / Elders.crescent / Sweep/Winter), `sec:reference-cone` (Work/G09.answer and Brioche.diet). All remain draft with explicit input boundaries; their mathematical text is in the correspondingly named files listed in unit.json.

### Continued construction details

`reference-difference.tex` and `reference-match.tex` prove the same-history signed
comparison and replicated observable matching, with exact source assumptions
and local independent passes recorded in `ope-evidence.md` and the review report.
`local-splitting.tex` and `local-sections.tex` expand the actual finite jet
readout, support-mask correction, existing-gas recovery, and polynomial section
construction; detailed crosswalk/status is in `local-projection-evidence.md`.
The reviewed free-kernel pair is now integrated; its evidence files preserve
the actual alias and divisor definitions. Remaining nonlinear/raw expansion,
calendar, calibration, phase and UV obligations are not deemed discharged by
these local arguments. No completeness or accepted-review status is asserted.

Further source-following producer expansion (19:35 UTC): the root author has
added `leaf-transfer`, `leaf-expansion`, and `cluster-expansion`. The first two
have independent conditional local passes; the connected-cluster/log chapter
is pending review. The latter proves the actual repeated-occurrence cluster
bound and real logarithm identity from vertex site prices, including BFS graph
cancellation and the source's `4 h_B gamma/delta` branching threshold. This
removes a combinatorial input to the differentiated insertion argument; actual
nonlinear vertex estimates, the full fusion/block identities, singleton profile
and selected-history purchase remain outstanding. Details and commands are in
`local-projection-evidence.md`. Full existence is not claimed or complete.

The selected-history `centered-construction.tex` is now integrated at the
independently reviewed conditional local snapshot
`0686cb230b2de4c9a12e6c8391dec333490d6448247da7e06e0415977e606bec` (evidence
`9b47ad1ff972e7a382b4de8c93b7c0f9ff330742f9d1ef59c4e221445b6a56b3`). This
resolves the common `ex-centered-sail` denominator/served-price reference.
It proves the +6M actual centered price, opened-depth arithmetic and conditional
served-slab induction through the actual public route; it retains explicit
nonlinear menu/response and common bounded-label selected-history inputs.
The limits author is continuing the actual Freight producer in a disjoint
chapter, not treating this conditional result as completion.

### Analytic vertex prices and core gain, continued checkpoint
The integrated `gaussian-warnings` and `packet-estimates` chapters prove the
simultaneous correlated-warning estimate and the actual norm-before-integration
passage, including one marked vertex; core/annulus energy accounting, full
normalization cost, closed-mask derivative absorption and packet entropy payment.
The stronger reviewer passed these local arguments conditionally at the hashes
in validation.md. `seed-energy.tex` now expands the core gain itself through
E05 curvature deficit, E06 discarded fine rows and E09 full reserve assembly;
its independent review is pending. No final existence/completion claim.

### Seed geometry and actual predictor, 2026-11-11

New `seed-geometry.tex` proves the previously displayed geometric input in
`seed-energy.tex`: `YM.Work.E01.answer`, with its actual `YM.Pressure.qdc`
producer. Pinned revision remains 3456e5e75cf8d4cd558955a5c7638fba2d68f464.
Full source inspection: `Lean/YM/Branch/{Slide,Pick}.lean`,
`Lean/YM/Pressure/{Route,Single,Gauge,Macro,Cost}.lean`,
`Lean/YM/Work/E01.lean`, and `Lean/YM/Pressure/Seeds.lean` (the previous
pending full Seeds read is now complete); immediate minimizing-frame
self-consistency inspected in `Lean/YM/Branch/Synchronize.lean` lines 1–210.

- `eq:geometry-axial`: `YM.Axial.variation`, `slide_le`, `window_le`,
  `total_slab`, `existence`, `eligible`; induction on coordinate slabs,
  chosen minimum-curvature slice, factor 16 times side in dimension four.
- `eq:geometry-path-count`: `YM.Pressure.route_sum`, `YM.Pressure.Road.route`
  (qualified namespace of route_sum to be checked), endpoint-slot permutation
  and coordinate-line counting.
- `eq:geometry-cluster`: `YM.Pressure.price_square`, `income_bounds`, `cluster`,
  `YM.Branch.Pairs.self_consistent`; no cardinality factor. The prose uses the
  equivalent local tubular-projection Lipschitz consequence of the group data
  for the nearest-point step; source uses `Gauge.nearest_approximate` directly.
- `eq:geometry-frame`: `YM.Pressure.Road.strips`, `revenue`, `risks`, `fallback`,
  `synchronized`; positive frame mass essential for fallback eligibility.
- `eq:geometry-predictor-curvature`: `YM.Pressure.planting`, `indicated`,
  `qdc`, with `light`, `traverse`, `price_query`, `comp`. Frame constants are
  fixed before block side; every predictor output is covered.
- `eq:geometry-port`/`eq:geometry-port-column` and witness:
  `YM.Work.E01.port_charge`, `mcharge_le_one`, `mcharge_maps`, `mcharge_count`,
  `place_card`, `dome_card`, `outs_card`, `hit_card`, `flag_count`, `witnessed`,
  `answer`. Macro lift multiplicity is not suppressed on short tori.

A bounded literature query for lattice axial gauge first-power sum estimates
returned general lattice-gauge surveys and related variational papers, but no
checked match to the exact either-branch predictor estimate. No outside theorem
is cited or used for this step; the Lean route is proved directly. No novelty
claim follows from that search. Targeted stronger-agent review requested at
SHA256 a363d89d6049be8f02a976c1f99af02a9794486450d73b1a9bad0c525dceeb68.

its remaining guide, hit and unhit analytic inputs are unchanged.
No fresh Lean build or axiom replay was performed for either chapter.

### Physical kernels, guides and affected comparison (2026-11-11)

`seed-guides.tex` proves the E03/E04 consumers at the exact per-type cover
strip and `PathData.Bounds` interfaces. Full reads: `Lean/YM/Work/E03.lean`,
`E04.lean`, `Lean/YM/Pressure/Rows.lean`, and `Bid/Energy.lean` definitions
of `Anchored`, `Allowance`, `LaneCounts`, `Maximum`.
Main correspondences: `YM.Work.E03.anchored_of_terms`, `lane_anchored`,
`leap_anchored`, `answer`; `YM.Work.E04.priced_le`, `back_sum_le`,
`shorten_valued`, `shorten_small`, `lanes`, `thinned_le`, `max_paid`, `answer`.
The wide column counts all L^4 residues. Actual row label sums survive
periodic coincidences. Path-data production remains open, not hidden by this
consumer proof. Frozen review request:
1f2f78c243c69dd5d2aeeeb332feb152a501609fecd3df49575682939c04d0a5.

`seed-hit-comparison.tex` supplies E07 from E01/E03/E04. Full reads:
`Lean/YM/Work/E07/{Columns,Local,Defects}.lean` and `Lean/YM/Work/E07.lean`.
Main declarations in `YM.Work.E07`: `unzip_total`, `plottedExcess_total`,
`plotted_le`, `coarse_split`, `macroExcess_total`, `fine_total`, `noise_total`,
`coarse_total`, `workL_total`, `workD_ge`, `price_at`, `answer`.
The prose reproduces preBill/seatBill with u=sqrt(high.direct)+d,
v=sqrt(low.direct)+d and the actual two Bool slots. Fine excess threshold is
fiery t; noise excess includes all aisles; only the hit-region cardinality
uses largeT. Frozen review request:
024689a73201f022a761a27f7268aa00c8823ee97df716fb57a541c4e5787a76.

`seed-tree-patch.tex` supplies E02/E08. Full reads `Lean/YM/Work/E02.lean`,
`E08.lean`; immediate forest definitions and hiking proofs in
`Lean/YM/Tree/Pines.lean` lines 17–115. Main declarations:
`YM.Work.E02.root_walk`, `pad_root`, `answer`;
`YM.Work.E08.axial_patch`, `unhit_local`, `port_le`, `stitches_of_shell`,
`answer`. Some helper declarations are private; quoted qualified names denote
their source namespace, not a claim about their compiler-generated private
name. The arbitrary given forest, full lifted root walk, and common macro
gauge are retained. This proves the post-L common C_L B^10 largeT gauge
bound. Frozen review request:

with J≥4 and explicitly nonwrapping macro-column hypothesis. The previously
flagged route_sum namespace is confirmed `YM.Pressure.route_sum`.
All machine review fields remain null; no human acceptance claimed.

### Unhit comparison and predictor branch producer (2026-11-11)

Full reads of `Lean/YM/Next/FLUCTUATIONS/{Defs,Charts,Kernel,Slots,Prediction,
Linear,Global,Locality,Covariance,Interior,Scales,Bare}.lean` support
`seed-unhit-comparison.tex`. Names below are in `YM.Next.Fluctuations`:
`roll_l`/`roll_d` → exact full linear cancellations; `face_chart_cost`,
`x_chart_cost`, `z_chart_cost` → local Taylor terms; `routed_price`,
`kernel_chart_cost` → real transported cut/full row-and-column error;
`global_chart_cost` → error combination; `local_gaps`, `gauge_gaps`,
`extend_interior`, `interior_cost` → original same-data local bound with
free operand w; `radius_stitch_errors`, `bare` → volume-independent delay
and the EBare sum. Explicit positive η and fixed colour normalization were
added on reviewer request; latest SHA
6a1aa82fcc2e7c3ae57dd06d495cbe75102f443610894866235f6ec8a90a3bb0.
The complete Flat Roll and Attached path producers remain assigned to the
lattice author. The predictor input is now developed in the next chapter.

`predictor-branch.tex` follows the actual uniform branch/analytic derivative
route, not a replacement gauge choice. Full reads of
`Lean/YM/Branch/{Center,Synchronize,Uniform}.lean`, `Pick.lean` through
`viable`, `Lean/YM/PREC/{Implicit,Pred,Derivative,FrameResponse}.lean`,
`Lean/YM/Branch/Predict.lean`; exact branch definitions in RG/Patch and
continuity/open-branch proofs in RG/Measurable lines 1–85 were inspected.

- `eq:branch-projection` is the local derivative form of
  `Gauge.nearest_approximate`; the group chart data supplies the analytic
  nearest projection and derivative Π.
- Uniform normalized frame uniqueness: `YM.Branch.Pairs.compare_energy`,
  `cluster`, `closeness`, `changes`, `weak_changes`, `YM.Branch.align`,
  `YM.RG.frame_unique`. Uniform weighted predictor uniqueness:
  `YM.Branch.min_iff`, `weighted_unique`, `YM.RG.predictor_unique`.
  Fallback and constants: `YM.Axial.eligible`, `viable`.
- Analytic rooted frame: `YM.RG.minArg_cont`, `Patch.selected_cont`,
  `YM.Push.authored`, `threshold`, `hat_cont`, `stars`, `scheme`.
  Ambient matrix derivative injectivity uses the single pinned centre.
- `eq:branch-frame-derivative`: `YM.Push.derivative`, including uniform
  `tap` before applying smoothing weights.
- `eq:branch-probe`: `YM.Push.lips`, `prediction_cont`, `decks`,
  `income_eq`, `prices`, and `YM.Precision.probe`, `fixRoot`,
  `root_gradient`; correction is mean+d0*fixRoot, not mean alone.
- Gauge compatibility: `YM.RG.Patch.frame_gauged`, `bond_gauge`,
  `YM.RG.StepData.updateGauged`.

The analytic implicit function theorem is used in the same finite-dimensional
ambient form as existing local-section arguments. No new literature result
or physical interpretation was inferred from declaration names.

These do not assert completion of the existence proof or human acceptance.

### Actual annular producer, 2026-11-11

`packet-annulus.tex` supplies the local value annulus input of packet-estimates,
conditional on the same quantitative path/kernel and flat-stack data already
named there. Additional flat identity: N0 Bc dc=0 (`Towers.Roll.oPart`).
Its current author fingerprint is 7e643cb194091270f36271fce490245ef8e36b37d7b80fddc08c9d0ceaf5dba6;
independent review requested, not yet passed. It does not prove packet jets.

### Actual sector Gram floor and upper price, 2026-11-11

New `sector-gram.tex` (aab3d4881f92ec78d6d7635452def57385d14473cc3412d00622ea8f807550fb)
proves the actual completed precision floor via local gauges and the tree
comparison, not from a postulated global flat gap. Independent review requested.
At pin3456e5e75cf8d4cd558955a5c7638fba2d68f464, full source reads:
- `Lean/YM/Work/F01.lean`: YM.Work.F01.chord_limit, port_le, usable_near,
  represent_deriv, link_bound. The other global Hessian helpers were inspected
  but are not needed for this selected-row proof.
- `Lean/YM/AnalyticNext/CONNECTED_ACTIVITY_JETS_E6/Gram.lean`:
  YM.ConnectedActivityE6.Coat.motion, priced, form, sleepy, plate, linearBill,
  charged_for, pricing, in_count, balance, cold, asleep, toned.
- Same directory Currents.lean: Coat.manifest/current/response, replies,
  units, driving. Coercion.lean: along_age, raised, lens_split, counted_up,
  energized. These give local selected-row control and global overlap absorption.
- Same directory Ceils.lean: Thin.mul, Coat.plume/span, form_price, charges.
  Compression.input_decays and Transport.transported_impulse supply the
  weighted impulse bound; those files read fully in the preceding annulus work.
- Census.lean and FieldCount.lean: parent multiplicity, signed/type counts,
  for_neighbors, summons, pays_count, rows. Full files read.
The external-background search uses the previously consulted shared index:
this is a source-specific elementary finite-matrix/axial argument, no new
literature theorem substituted. Matrix inverse locality, Gaussian density
normalization/mean bounds, and analytic jets are not claimed here.

29461555fd5eeb24f58f1a4d4ec2896fb4cb85ae60bc3c4aa03248ddc2e86218;
independent review requested. It proves local principal inverses, the actual
symmetrized finite-range covariance, ordered inverse series, Jacobi local and
correction log-determinant expansions, local comparison and colour-block gauge
invariance. It does not identify whole-volume logdet bounds with hit prices.

Full inspected files at source pin3456e5e75cf8d4cd558955a5c7638fba2d68f464:
- Lean/YM/Progress/STATIONARY_SCENES/Green.lean: Green.Rows/Both/Bottom,
  restricting, diminishing, schur, inverse (including all nonnegative shifts).
- Lean/YM/AnalyticNext/CONNECTED_ACTIVITY_JETS_E6/Windows.lean:
  Window, principal, pad, error, mileage; Coat.frames actual bond-end windows.

### Actual remote Gaussian mean

`local-mean.tex`, initial fingerprint f32876889ca48172b9399bafc1ff983ae0eee0750d4d7dd4329c2211ce60f1b5, is under independent review. Source pin unchanged. Fully inspected:
- `Lean/YM/AnalyticNext/CONNECTED_ACTIVITY_JETS_E6/Voyage.lean`: `YM.ConnectedActivityE6.SliceRows.Stamp`, `shifted`, `spring`, `linear_energy`, `oriented_energy`, `accords`. Main steps: actual diagonal action, signed quadratic invariance, three energy/inner-product equalities imply each linear row vanishes.
- Same directory `Via.lean`: `spring_cap`, `rotor_copy`, `rear`. Replica and sign conventions retained.
- `Lean/YM/Progress/STATIONARY_SCENES/Response.lean`: `YM.Progress.StationaryScenes.Response.integral_near`, `psi`, `start`, `straighten_price`, `action_price`, `response_price`, `tangent_apply`. Actual tree/patch length bound supplies sup response cap; no false uniform nonlinear IFT estimate.
- E6 `SmallLog.lean`: `SliceRows.flattening` (clean V, one larger hull, global bounded log extension).
- `Guide.lean`: `linearGuide`, `zip_zero_N`, `complete_vision`, `zip_guide`, `read_guides`. Clipping removed locally before comparison.
- `Resolve.lean`: `Coat.radiate`, `trench`, `raft`, `retreat`. Four exact errors; gauge and actual signal share candidate.
- `Mean.lean`: `Coat.intensive`, `coil`, `drift_point`, `hips`, `pressure_mean`. Mean uses transpose padded inverse, not symmetrized covariance; normal-residual and inverse-error terms separated.
- `Shutter.lean`: `driftM`, `mu` (Greek mu in source), `Rotator`, `shoots`; previously inspected Gram and inverse inputs reused.
No new literature invocation: shared index checked, finite algebra/Taylor steps follow Lean. Actual flat diagonal/horizon/path production remains the declared incoming interface, assigned to lattice author. No mean derivative or nonlinear global stationary assertion. Commands: cat these files, targeted rg to locate declarations; no Lean build.

### Haar chart and differentiated local normalization

Haar initial b55944e9c20884cffa86166ab453ec44a7a35fe37ffc172602d93fffe61c2343 corrected after review to fecd73018a272af1ee6d9245f38d01fc5fc4e71ac343bae684a38e449ff67a05: explicitly uses prescribed t=P(h)/sqrt(h) and reciprocal upper exponent+1/2. Fully inspected `Lean/YM/PCalc/Loop.lean` ChartRatio/LocalRatio; `Lean/YM/LocalH/Chart.lean` YM.LocalH.geom_patch, coat/spin, spins; `Lean/YM/LocalH/Haar.lean` YM.LocalH.actual with local overlap and compact Haar averaging. Main prose gives full finite-dimensional local density construction, not an assumed tangent density. E6 Caps.gentry/doorway/germ_charge supply doubled-cutoff/value; Inc.fostered and Intrados.kernels/puffs supply boundary-safe derivative argument. Hallmark.inverse_mist supplies reciprocal threshold bound. Compensated fluctuation-jet premise remains explicit.

`normalization-jets.tex` initial cfacb090cc185872fee2694f44e9aabbea867196dea54b9993da22ccbe58cb02 under independent review. Source pin unchanged, E6 directory fully inspected files:
- Rewards: Coat.condensation, postedBase, rotation_at, condenses. Correction is half blank minus actual local colour trace.
- Dye: Coat.blank, no_flat, blank_all, dye_for, dye; same forest/windows and common6B hull.
- Tablet: entrywise Brush majorants and weighted matrix algebra.
- Terminal: Tablet.call/inverter, token/driftP; finite geometric expansion and remainder with k+1 vanishing factors.
- Arcade: Tablet.faraway/across/emboss, facePrice; variable windows retain row and column census.
- Gust: Foramen.thunder/puncture/padjets/wavesP/treasure/debris.
- Impasto: zeroProduct/links/reverse/tour; unitary value prevents exponential path amplitude.
- Engrave, Arcus, Tint: actual adjoint transport, Mode, signed/replica invariance.
- Rainbowline: Gate.whirl; Castro: replicaM/plates/jet_growth/polynomial. Actual form impulse decays; flags and active sets frozen.
- StreamsA: Vine.joyful/plotsB; Osmote: yoga/yogic compact parameter differentiation.
- Clods: Vine.mistropy; Hallmark.shrinker. Remote value plus small derivative scale yields remote jets without differentiating local gauges.
Commands: targeted rg then cat/sed of these files; no Lean build. Shared literature index consulted; elementary finite matrix, product and change-of-variable arguments are proved. Local mean passed independent conditional review at its original f328... fingerprint; incoming flat construction still tracked.

Normalization final b09f9c2e47a94e33af1c9bc040a01eff22715aeb8a8aaf237d83099e6a955a96 explicitly states nonnegative envelope/scales; independent pass received. Haar final fecd73018a272af1ee6d9245f38d01fc5fc4e71ac343bae684a38e449ff67a05 independently passed.

### Coherent compensated variation

`compensated-variation.tex` initial7853e505e5f2c5bc25324cce5cbb91975eb4c5886570554df67095a7a94e9860 under review. Fully inspected E6 Eider/Pommel/Eskim/Plise/Jac/Cincture; Scroll inspected through `yields` (not later declarations). Source pin unchanged. Exact declarations:
- `YM.ConnectedActivityE6.Blaze.Eider.weave`, `plume/fleece`, `nothing_f`, `sustaining`, `sheen/lamina/limn`, `vies`, `thorax/cozies`; compact fixed chart before threshold, global contraction and positive determinant, all-sample parameter jets.
- `Blaze.Silica.action/steer/course`, `proceeds/home`, `nearby/conquered`, `Clutch/clips`; relative replica product order retained, protected8at bound, all-variable identity and fixed fine input.
- `Blaze.Flux.stereo/chore/pitch`, `has_chore/across`, `blocks/almanac/gyre`; counting colour block determinant and cancellation of g_beta factors, empty lens included.
- `Blaze.Vine.strain/bar/leanB/well/voltage/worldZ`, `safe_hull/strains/pricingP/agrees_all/shine`; unmasked extension equals actual affine mean on selected clean sectors.
- `Blaze.Scroll.canopy/frameCost`; already proved clipping removal on actual read stencil. `Blaze.Mode` and `Tint.fromLogL/expCost` supply actual scaled exponential variation, finite marked directions.
No claim of Gaussian density-score bounds; those remain to prove. No Lean command. Shared literature index consulted; elementary contraction, compact chart, determinant and change-of-variables arguments follow source.


### Mean and local action derivatives

`mean-action-jets.tex` is a draft under independent review. Source pin unchanged. Full inspected E6 files: Vignette, Harmonic, Parterre, Modes, Chroma, Schism, Tatami, Olive, Interpolate, Rasura, Checkered, Courants, Stove, Sortie, Hogs. Exact chain:
- `YM.ConnectedActivityE6.Blaze.Shadow.transfers`: finite cover read hull, reference torus with lift-wrap identity, norm-one pullback, tags and branch equality. `Blaze.Frond.predicts_mul/dressed` supplies actual nonlinear predictor jets, not just linear response.
- `Blaze.Gate.beam/certifiedBranch`, `Blaze.ascend/recover_price`, `Blaze.Gate.base_ray`: dimension-independent velocity/Hessian interpolation on shrinking flat test ball, then fixed-gauge logarithmic composition. Explicit t=mist=h^(-1/2), distinct from fiery threshold.
- `Blaze.Hallmark.jewelled` (previous source inspection), `Blaze.Vine.luster`, `Blaze.vines/shiver`: frozen cut logs, actual unmasked selected source, transpose padded mean, score residual -A(P-A^-1)^t ell and sqrt(beta) loss.
- `Blaze.measures/enCanvas`, `Blaze.wild`, `Blaze.hearthLift`, `Blaze.cabinet/centralSum`: actual curvature/noise/guide inner-product costs; held fine clipped energy constant; local hot read and at-most-two parents; normalized signed average.
- `Blaze.Silica.Clutch.stilly`: log packet subtraction, beta upper bound, 200B/304B census and doubled jet amplitude. This supplies first packet-local-jet-inputs bound conditional on already-declared incoming construction/path/clean/precision inputs. Not a Gaussian reassembly or complete existence claim.
Shared literature index checked; this finite interpolation/product argument is proved directly following Lean. Commands run: targeted rg and cat of listed files. No Lean build or source edits. Independent review pending. Compensated variation at 7853e505e5f2c5bc25324cce5cbb91975eb4c5886570554df67095a7a94e9860 passed independent local review; its remaining mean-jet supplier is handled here.


### Differentiating projected Gaussian integrals

`gaussian-differentiation.tex` is under independent review. Source pin unchanged. Exact substantive source route (E6 directory):
- Levan: `YM.ConnectedActivityE6.Blaze.Shield.lens₀/magnifies/recommends/bars/selfish`; principal marginal density and actual read-support reduction. Standard finite Gaussian density derived in prose by orthogonal diagonalization/product change of variables; Skyline implementation not newly fully inspected here.
- Pendant: `Blaze.Flux.combs/jewels`; principal-minor expansion, vanishing minors above derivative order, polynomial projected-rank cost. Mesoglea: `crystalLog/oriflamme` uses true full projected determinant and inverse, ratio amplitude one.
- Afresh: `Blaze.Flux.protect/squarePulse/winglet`; local inverse floor, bounded displacement, Gaussian-over-reference integrable derivative envelope. Period dependent domination separated from uniform moment estimates.
- Tropolis: `scalp/recoil/rhythm/slab/transition`; actual Jacobian times projected Gaussian ratio, confined enlarged read support, full base measure restored by its marginal. Exact locality is an incoming read-support property here, not a claim of independent coordinates.
- Duster: `Coat.cold_pad_crys/uniform_crys/colorless_crys/emitting_crys/calm_crys/crystals`; inactive identity and endpoint vanishing persist on open nonsingular principal-window neighborhood.
- Thistle: `Transfer.grain/plumeJ/outfit/spinning/flutter/carries`; Paisley: `prune/braided/fruit/thatch`; all actual masked species survive compact truncation with held U fixed. Ether/Pinene/Fairum/Ambit: compact chart families, frozen-label bounds, source/mean finite sums, all masked species; `Glass.towers/thorn` supplies uniform-in-sample local C^j bounds.
- Meristem: `calls/buds`; Orin: `Meristem.slopes/legs/points`; finite basis difference quotient measurability and dominated integral differentiation. Mercury: `Flux.boosts/chutes/coterie` applies identity and derivative interchange, then separately supplied uniform moment envelope.
All named files fully read this stage except explicitly indicated Skyline. Shared literature index previously checked; elementary finite matrix and dominated convergence proofs supplied rather than added literature search. No fresh Lean build. Remaining moment-price/reassembly suppliers are not claimed proved by this local differentiation theorem. Mean/action exact fine energy constant corrected to (paths R_G^2)^2/2+2direct+2linear, hash eb8d4daa19846b281a483d178a0df2a6157c30033c08e05923de39d0b2552db3, reviewer notified.


### Reviewed precision tower and Gaussian differentiation checkpoint

Integrated lattice-author `rg-horizon-geometry.tex` final 7f2c6daa457cbf140b08fa19775a51229d131c4de3bc284839dc99ef8ac1153e and evidence fe9a61b00ee04d82abeacbbf8002300f04a0d15c2cf2eebfd7c6eb3c9e17ffed after independent local pass. Evidence final old sentence saying review not requested is superseded by this checkpoint and the independent report. Correct F09 finite block domains, F08 mixed carry bound, inherited donated difference prices and same-history Attached route are proved. Bed/flight/factor/numeric credit and PathData.Bounds remain explicit incoming analytic suppliers. No claim those follow from block algebra.

Mean/action eb8d4daa... passed. Gaussian differentiation e1c6e1e1afe662d0843154ecfc6177e64161aa0a00138859df188a33acb899a8 passed local conditional review.

Ticket price still stated as input. No accepted-status fields changed.

### Uniform Gaussian moment prices

`gaussian-moment-prices.tex` initial47742392a8da1d483ea27b5e04859ee74c0ceaa53e15f3dde826fb87ee731bcc under independent review. E6 source files fully inspected: Brushhold (`Blaze.Flux.facescale/expenses/own_mat/feast/meager`, polynomial closure), Spheres (`elevates`), Cirrus (`tokens/prices/rump`), LogosG (`reining/salience/globes`), Splay (`spaces/crewsC/walksW/divideC`), March (`accent/launch`); Lambent `worthy/acreage` inspected as selected declarations. One-coordinate mgf, maximum-coordinate moment domination, projected support rank, CS half-warning reserve and exact old-Haar×Gaussian integral price are proved. Full all-species pointwise Utopia estimates remain explicit upstream input. This section does not infer independence or pay full-volume determinant. Shared literature index consulted; finite Gaussian/probability arguments proved directly. No Lean build.


### Remote local action jets and likelihood price

`remote-action-jets.tex` draft follows E6 source at the unchanged pin. Fully read this stage: Modes (`Blaze.Frond.squarepot/ivy/growth`), Interpolate (`ascend/recover_price`, already proved), Lagoon (`probe_window/ivy_windows/evokes`), Outer (`SliceRows.letters_N/C/LD`), Erosion (`shoreVisa/rivers`), Lakeside (`concentration/earth`), Serene (`Clutch.billpack/star_earth`), Periscope (`Vine.passage/rain`), Plover (`Clutch.certified_hat/flyers`), Clods (`Vine.mistropy`), Palmate (`Clutch.flick`). Cubic scalar remainder is combined with unmasked all-order bounds on a fixed chart, then dimension-independent flat probing and fixed-gauge local composition. No derivative of a value inequality or selected gauge. Actual held U, signed relative increment, 7B/8 read patch, beta and at most two residual squares retained. The source's funded/stamped, same-history sector and path hypotheses remain incoming; this is not a new supplier for them.

Packet likelihood paragraph added from `YM.ConnectedActivityE6.Mask.tickets_le`, dome_count/readBonds_count/tollFee, with `Sector.siteMass/pinMass/site_cap/pin_cap` inspected. One normalized likelihood per physical site/bond; all uses of a retained tag share it. Gaussian moment final 1af91c12763673d51ec84b07d2719babf0552eeaad1e2345b0c9acdc1f3b0d16 passed independent local review. Shared literature index read; direct finite interpolation and product argument, no new external claim. Commands: targeted rg, cat/sed of named files; no Lean build. Independent review of new remote text and ticket delta pending.


### Gaussian itinerary derivatives and rooted prices

`itinerary-prices.tex` draft expands the remaining correction-chain bridge. Fully read E6 Pedi (`Blaze.canon/plurality`), Cascades (`Vine.glacierA/glacierS`), Moraine (`Clutch.occupancy/spindle/slopeLedger`), StreamsCost (`Vine.fluid/enlighten`), Corbel (`Clutch.waits`), Trail (actual Itinerary/Armed/visited, pockets/tenure), Tax (`Itinerary.scalar`) and Export (`out`). Matrix words lengths n+3,n+1,n+2 retained with colour factors q^4,q^2,q^4, respectively. Protected endpoints are used only after zero-germ cases, derivative length absorbed before rooted enumeration, support and 2epsilon length reserve explicitly paid. Depends on prior normalization/mean jets and incoming funded positive precision/path data, not a new linear-RG supplier. Independent reviewer supplied a read-only gap audit and source formulas; parent wrote the proof and requested independent checking.

Remote mean paragraph corrected following review: newly fully inspected Mutada (`Blaze.nearby/quenched`) and Dryland (`Vine.abridge`), supplying a uniform inverse floor on the shrinking probe ball by thin row/column perturbation from the blank zero field. Does not assume manifest/Healthy probes throughout that ball. No fresh Lean build; new text pending review. Packet ticket delta passed local review.


### Inherited activity price conversion

`inherited-activity-prices.tex` draft: source unchanged, fully read E6 Weights (`Sales.anchored_sale/paths/rotated/together/atom`), Paths (`Raw.pairTail/long/pairPrice/pair_sum/pairFoot/pair_local`), PathPrices (`tail_sale/atom_sale/tail_bills/atom_bills`), Receiving (`core_bills/atoms_meet/tails_meet/inherit_bills`), Intake (`incomingE/K/loopBill`, Application.intake_at), Borax (`Clutch.dicers`), Sleet (`Clutch.hearth`), Aria (`Clutch.central`). Full footprint conversion proof inspected in YM/Push/ABSOLUTE_SUMS/Footprint.lean, Path.lean and Fees.lean, with geometric producer YM/Corona/Spend.lean and its Fit.lean/Halo.lean. Source-shaped connected-cover projection factor10/L, anchor population and degree summation, true path lengths/tail selection, two extra epsilon reserves and actual beta retained. Six log families plus forced values, coarse tail derivative exception, full old supports and fixed fine U handled. Incoming Lawful label/path budgets are explicit assumptions here, maintained by the separate construction route; no claim that this scalar conversion produces them. Shared literature index consulted; finite combinatorics and elementary calculus are proved directly. No Lean build/source edits. Independent review pending.

Remote-action final7313d950..., itinerary-prices final0ac00a29..., packet ticket final9bbc82f... have independent local conditional passes. Machine approval fields remain null.


### All-species derivative assembly and centered integration

`activity-jet-assembly.tex` follows E6 Inc (`Brush.expands`), Staunch (`Clutch.pay_busy`), Aria (`Clutch.ash/central`), Icosa (`Clutch.sleek`), Das (`Utopia.whittle`), all fully read. Small log-price implies exp-minus-one jet-price by explicit partition bound; warning local germs use xi/2 and strict safety plateau, with held fine likelihoods; all-species product and sqrt-warning reserve give actual moment premise. Incoming deterministic safety/plateau production remains stated; assembling prices does not construct the funded history. Previous Gaussian/packet/remote/inherited/itinerary chapters supply the other displayed local estimates conditional on their precise premises. No Lean build; independent review pending.

Integrated limits-author centered-public-service b584367d81f4195e5fdd9f980e465cef990432a17f3e1ae2abdcaf072bb6c1d9 and centered-geyser-scale-estimates a9803efbc98af990dd2764e5207fc010a75d8a7009117457890266beb7f72147 after independent conditional local passes. Their detailed evidence files accompany the text. The service retains volume ratio q=(a_m/a_k)^4 and actual residual treasury exp(qT_k+6)/w. Geyser distinguishes frame degree m_d from marker exponent m_d+4. Funded/profile/response inputs remain explicit; these are not whole-proof completion claims.

### Exact Gaussian and probability-Haar reassembly

`gaussian-reassembly.tex` final 7db9a420bbfd50dffb67e0dcf5010f163f875f23d34fcc299eaddf312fb8c535 independently passed local conditional review. At the unchanged source pin, fully inspected E6 Unified (`Coat.forceds/distributions/fuse/underfoot/precip`), UnifiedValue (`unified_exp/consolidated`), Fact (`Raw.estate/fused`, Coat count/payment/levy/deducted/thetaRef/ribbons), Steam, Depot, Acquiesce (`flowFood/fueled/speckle/mglows/glowing`), Vapour (`arranges/cultures/mates/vents`), Funnel/Walt (quadratic completion, inactive completion and endpoint cutoffs), Tickets (`budgets_arr/luxury/recede`), Buoy (`comfy/dormant_energy/seat/ticket`), BridgeL (`fair_summable/uplink/perK/sum_alloc`), Shore, Amass, Density (`Matter.trace/render/real_push/overhead_pos`), Fairground (`Cash.rides/red_carpet`) and Manifesto (`cap_iff/amounts/alliance/fromOne`). Also directly inspected Assignment.covers_paths. Exact physical Q, inactive identity, one normalized tag average, flat determinant, local incidence and finite-range Gaussian independence retained. Log-envelope summability is separate from integrated activity-price summability. Whole selected-history funding remains incoming.

### Deterministic warning safety producer

`warning-safety.tex` a251f7dce9e180c25dd2e81661d406e0fd9c4600078a68aec42740d4e7318c68 expands the actual safety supplier, after independent reviewer traced the source path and parent independently read it. Fully read E6 Peak (`Coat.scopes/ready/watch_bonds`, tiny_flame), PatchCap (`SliceRows.layered/strokes/tags_at/marks_here`), MinBranches (`Forward.approves`, cover_guard, patch_check), Accuracy.within and support helpers, RootCap (`gauge_at/faces_near/X_local/crowns`), AffOrd (`valent/freedom/dividend`), StampQ.tends_val, Mean.pressure_mean and Target.issue/GrantBodies.safety in Issue. Fixed-radius base-stroke cap and mean invoice proved; five-error nonlinear comparison and three-error small-fluctuation estimate give exact all-tag masses=1 and strict fine/predictor plateaus. Source caller supplies it through Invoices to Cash; no assumption that ordinary branch IFT by itself gives a torus-uniform likelihood plateau. Final three clarifications (path cutoff, radius-five endpoint margin, B>=2d+12) await reviewer fingerprint acknowledgment. No Lean edits/build.

### Full-mesh and scalar-price supplements

Integrated author fullmesh-fixedbounds-producer final 4767fd1083ee5d1306daff76caf301b69d3e462b037644b71045df57ad928174 after independent local pass; parent editorial-only final edc5c612ab174a3aecd027a6bec0e80d8d4a49e6f5a6e66fe476c20622568dab removes implementation names from prose. Evidence is adjacent. Global row-family cost closure, separate equation/null residual payments, and two-scale cell span retained. This does not itself supply same-history Cauchy convergence. Integrated lattice-author rg-price-receipts 0b10c1fb0eb1d195f38864febfc5483fd11e309883fa14efdd90a35722591107 with evidence 4bc0192c2a84574c6c04c8e9d23d2461d1d040f461dfb1e82c905c580f220e28 after independent scalar pass. Arrival/gain and reset inputs remain distinct from the proved tariff decay. Shared literature index consulted; these finite algebra/probability and scale arguments are proved directly, without a new external theorem claim.

### Forest averaging, regular logarithm and forced exclusion

`forest-average-log.tex` 7d4600bbdd67085480a36496e8fd17d8a8d0ba62fe8fda651ba0329acc64563f and `forced-exclusion.tex` 1132e7c0dc9c1a3a6fb049710979fd37e6e815f97e544122db5887077046d368 passed independent conditional local review. At the unchanged pin, fully inspected E6 JacF, Unimod, Silhouette, Hood; PhysicalNext/RG_NEXT_COMPLETE_REPEATABLE_NONLINEAR_STEP/Sward/Greenbelt, Cadre/Sprung,Toll,Tassel,Catkin,Aurora; ABSOLUTE_SUMS/Absence,Omissions,Copies; E6 Expanse,Bulkhead,Fire,Threshold. Selected Buyquote, DelayhatWin and OptionCost.costs definitions also inspected. Crosswalk: forest cochain determinant → `YM.ConnectedActivityE6.TreeColor.overhead_eq`; independent per-site average → `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Greenbelt.organizes`; local regular derivatives → `YM.ConnectedActivityE6.Blaze.March.Captain.collective/permitAverage`; exclusion regrouping → `YM.ConnectedActivityE6.Cash.bouquetPool/convoyPool` in Cadre/Catkin/Aurora; repeated-copy majorants → ABSOLUTE_SUMS.Omissions/Copies and E6.Bulkhead. Exact tuple factorial and exponential multiplicity factorial are distinct. Canonical absolute Ursell majorant is used in rooted estimate, not an arbitrary summable bound. Derivative assertions apply through the purchased finite order only at healthy configurations. The source-funded analytic inputs remain explicit. Shared literature index consulted; finite algebra and summation are proved directly. No fresh Lean checks.

### Actual marked block integral

`marked-block-integral.tex`7e65f60671d59310d69bc2053c0854d96e783ff9c1da5f9540e083c92fd018e1 passed independent local conditional review. Fully read at unchanged source pin: PhysicalNext/RG_NEXT_COMPLETE_REPEATABLE_NONLINEAR_STEP/Lotus/Postcards (`YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Lotus.Leaf.cicada/bud/sells/counted`), Parrot (`reduce/duel/world/posted`), Parcel (`YM.ConnectedActivityE6.Coat.chartersM/seatP`), Pygmy (`Leaf.premium/tip/approved`), Troika (`tons/tithes`), Tonic (`success`), Luminesce (`concur/coni`), Cascara (`sticksU/constell`), Pitcher (`harvest/streetP`), Satin (`paths/sailV`), Sofa (`together/summons`), and Daisy/Berries (`YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Daisy.Charity.sprained/tint`). Regular blank-address and forced same-address replacement distinguished; no division by K. Same chart normalization, cutoff plateau, actual Haar integral, single mark under connected decomposition and sitewise forest averaging proved. Subsequent tilt regrouping retains marked-price premises, supplied in separate marked-jets candidate. No Lean checks/source edits.


### Marked activity jets and common numerical selection

Source revision remains `3456e5e75cf8d4cd558955a5c7638fba2d68f464`.
`marked-activity-jets.tex` follows the actual marked-integral route, keeping the
inserted measurable function fixed under compensated transport. Inspected files
under `Lean/YM/PhysicalNext/RG_NEXT_COMPLETE_REPEATABLE_NONLINEAR_STEP/`:
Daisy/{Solvent,Gnomon,Charm,Pint,Morning,Kin,Rhyme,Corral,Rose,Sparks}.lean,
Lotus/{Class,Pane}.lean, and the Palette target definition. The proof supplies
mixed-product jets, Gaussian integration, local logarithmic differentiation,
and the two-stage forced-gas estimate. Principal singleton comparison and final
projection remain distinct dependencies. Local independent review passed at
aa69899d7ac9756bdd5993828a6b18c2e852f2a347bdfbe1e3de7c4fc6e01a87.

`nonlinear-payment-selection.tex` proves the scalar arrival and payment
inequalities used by these consumers. Inspected Mallow/{Eco,Stove}.lean,
MergeProof/{Tray,Heat}.lean, selected Ginger definitions, VerifiedReset
Currency/Tables, Investor and Tender.Rates. It includes the domain t<=1,
the actual two successive forced prices, and finite maxima across permitted
stage transitions. It does not establish the underlying analytic inputs.

`common-scale-selection.tex` proves the explicit slowly advancing schedule,
long plateaus, periods with late divisibility, mesh decay, and countable
numerical payments. Inspected `Lean/YM/Integration/` files
NativeDiagonalClockRequest, NativePostLengthPayment,
NativePreselectedPostnumericPeriodClock, NativePreselectedPostnumericPeriodRun,
NativeComponentRecipe and ActualRunNativeComponentRecipe; and the actual
Program.exhaust / Wait.engine recursion, PaneDivisors, PriceWaits/Length and
IntentWait/Paid definitions. Enlarged thresholds preserve conclusions on
realizations paying those thresholds. The chosen kernel, stage profiles,
block lengths and horizon are retained. Analytic suppliers and sublinear
window bounds remain separate obligations.

`phase-quantitative-producer.tex` is integrated with the agent evidence file.
It proves coefficient recovery, realification, finite-word telescoping,
radial decay under stated trajectory bounds, and four real pair-receipt
assembly, retaining actual local origin and positioned-convergence inputs.
The four pairs compare to real parts of complex products; there is no
replacement of Re(FG) by Re(F)Re(G).

Commands actually run: targeted rg/cat on the listed sources; blueprint checker
passed (2 units, structural only); latexmk found a display delimiter error and
two line overflows, now corrected and rebuilding. No Lean build or source edit.


### Actual elementary projection payments and marked profile

`projection-payment-producer.tex` passed bounded independent review at
5637b0d8aa15de99a7153a5778f54b2054ba92688c318a017dfd244d4a2c8e83.
At the pinned revision, inspected full source files and exact routes:
- `Lean/YM/MergeProof/North/Partly.lean`: `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Mercury.haze`;
  `North/Shawl.lean`: `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Mercury.shelves`.
  These bound the actual principal cluster by taking one nonnegative term
  from the rooted sum and retain zero principal for flagged input.
- `Lean/YM/PhysicalNext/RG_NEXT_COMPLETE_REPEATABLE_NONLINEAR_STEP/Blush/Little.lean`:
  `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Blush.glyph`, `efferv`, `fruition`;
  `Graces/Aspire.lean`: `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Graces.compass`, `coinFee`, `host`.
  Explicit normalized forced decay and hit-width bound pay all three small
  bills; no division by insertion mass, including the zero case.
- `Lean/YM/MergeProof/Coffer.lean`: `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Mallow.sandboxK`, `sounds`;
  `Thimble.lean`: `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Graces.cloudDrop`, `thunder`.
  The common transition is defined by the derivative of the actual twice-fused
  `pupil` array (Mallow/Brisk.lean). Entrywise equality precedes profiles;
  profile(output)-hook(response)=L^d profile(raw transition). Dominated
  product-index sums justify profile linearity. No inference from gas equality.
- `North/Angled.lean`: `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Graces.suppliesLeaf`;
  `North/Morsel.lean`: `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Graces.respects`;
  `North/Tibetan.lean`: `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Mallow.chant`, `shopping`,
  `swelling`, `harpo`; `North/Freckles.lean`:
  `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Legato.Bandage.thaw`, `sewed`.
  This is the actual selected elementary coupon consumer; the underlying
  sector/path data and other multi-insertion producers are still separately
  required. Fixed-degree projection price is paid by exp(sqrt(beta_f));
  pre-length geometric floors precede post-length numeric maxima.
No Lean commands or source edits. Shared literature index consulted; these
are elementary finite sums, scalar limits and already-proved local splitting.

### Positive beds, exact kernel transports, and curvature horizon

At source revision `3456e5e75cf8d4cd558955a5c7638fba2d68f464`, the parent
inspected the following bounded dependency chain in full (except the separately
noted, partial `Train/Miracles` read):

- `Lean/YM/Work/F07.lean`, `F07/MatrixRoot.lean`, `F07/Read.lean`:
  `YM.Work.F07` analytic binomial construction and all-period positive root.
  `positive-row-producer.tex` proves the collar, Fourier decay, inverse/root,
  and finite-period positivity. The inverse Neumann series is an elementary
  local variant of the adjugate formula in `Next/FREE_KERNELS/Warm.lean`.
- `Lean/YM/Next/FREE_KERNELS/{Hall,Warm,Amend,Dispatch}.lean` and
  `Lean/YM/FullVolume/Train/Wheels.lean`: `YM.Next.Free.obligations`,
  `strongBottom`, and positive bed construction. Exact `G d1 = H d1`,
  `(d2 B)G = D d2`, harmonic normalization, and the direct-noise factor are
  proved in the same chapter. `Bed.diagonal` is the unamended pulse H.
- `Lean/YM/Next/FREE_KERNELS/{Feed,Signal,Scripts,Portions,Pilot,Wire,ZeroAlias,Dispatch,Primal}.lean`:
  `YM.Next.Free.Train.D_feedback`, `YM.Next.Free.Flight.script_main`,
  `script_cross`, `script_dual`, `pilot_match`, `wire_match`, `genuine_alias`,
  `genuine_sum`, `scaled_tri`, `scaled_mul`, `adjust_adj`, and `tangent`.
  `kernel-transport-identities.tex` proves the feed/noise recursion, weighted
  exterior identities, both punctured columns, principal gain and brace
  cancellations, zero-mode values and L^-3 adjoint counting normalization.
  Analytic reflection acts on alias labels too: (p,l) maps to (-p,-l).
- `Lean/YM/Next/FREE_KERNELS/{SingleAxis,Lifts,Curl,Sell,Eject,Priced,Rack}.lean`:
  `YM.Next.Free.Double` double lift, `Flight.dep_zero`, `pledge_deposit`,
  `banked_dollars`, `intake`, `absorb_before`, `frontier`, `rebased`,
  `pledges`, and `retained_support`. `curvature-horizon-producer.tex` proves
  division by a coordinate difference with width loss, the double Cartan
  lift, uniform L^0 and L^-2 costs, positive amendment, common root, and
  adjacent-stage numerical selection. Its formerly retained tangent input
  is now supplied by the exact transport chapter.
- `Lean/YM/FullVolume/Train/{Wheels,Astute,Pins,Flour}.lean`:
  retained beds and A0/T, `YM.Bid.pinsT` and the existing tower completion.
  The final bounds distinguish iterated differences of A0/T from strip
  bounds of the other blocks. Nonlinear path attachment and full cutoff
  convergence remain separate work; a partial read of `Miracles.lean`
  is not claimed as a completed proof.

Independent bounded mathematical/source review passed the positive-row chapter
before display-only reflow and curvature before the exact transport cross-reference;
final fingerprints and renewed acknowledgments are in the reviewer report.
The transport proof received independent review and the real-cube and analytic
reflection precision edits. No machine-readable approval has been set.


## Principal singleton comparison (11 November, 22:20 UTC)

The two new sections `sec:principal-gaussian-comparison` and
`sec:principal-comparison-jets` follow the linear comparison, on one fixed
Gaussian space, of `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Mercury` (Glow, Rutter, Lagoon,
Radio, Riddle, Debonaire, Optics, BrimHeights, Sun, Symbols, Weld, Lugs,
Rim) and `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Malachite` (Stone, Mineral, Aperture,
Taps, Sheen, Tilth, Grain, Plot, Iceland, Searchlight, Poles, Relume),
under `Lean/YM/PhysicalNext/RG_NEXT_COMPLETE_REPEATABLE_NONLINEAR_STEP/`.
The exact primitive comparison rates are mean -1 and covariance -1/2 in
incoming fine beta; fixed chart Jacobian and measurable insertion are
retained. The two couplings agree only at flat fields. Reference coupling
jets are bounded separately with one extra derivative order. Varying-window
assembly reduces the exponential weight; the reference panels have inner
radius floor(B/60). The physical handoff uses seed-free read halos and a
fixed gauge germ, not a globally blank sector.

Additional inspected definitions: `YM.AnalyticBridge.SectorAffine.profileD`,
`.profileGram` in `Lean/YM/AnalyticBridge/SECTOR_AFFINE_JETS/MarkedGram.lean`;
`YM.AnalyticBridge.LocalGaussianLaws.both_bars` in its `LOCAL_GAUSSIAN_LAWS/Geometry.lean`
namespace;
`YM.PhysicalNext.JointLoad.Heir.Museum.reads_bare`, `.reach`, `.Canvas`,
`.crop` in `Heir/Museum.lean`, `Heir/Canvas.lean`;
`YM.PhysicalNext.JointLoad.Folio.Bulletin.clearance_size` in
`Folio/Wind.lean`, under `Lean/YM/PhysicalNext/V9_JOINT_ENDPOINT_LOAD/`.

Independent agent correspondence/math passes are recorded in the draft-review
log at snapshots ac21f608d8f153fa88222a602629caddf8b6303c343f709f087ddf0fc211ee1c
and ff624cbd11db727d32b9c3c50cf5540d2a048efb46e3e83b6c05c8b64dd1dded.
They retain earlier path/precision/chart hypotheses; no whole-proof completion
or human acceptance follows.

Blueprint refresh: read current main OS and Gaussian notes, and new draft
PR #30 at commit 7c69d335a00e103fa12a930a7d7fbb7b2db68ba0. The new nonlinear
RG audit is navigation evidence only. Its PaidView, Sworn kernel symmetry,
companyK public route, and separation of estimate production from pre-reset
presentation are retained as closure crosschecks. No separately owned note
was edited.


## Polynomial moments and discrete attenuation

`sec:polynomial-moment-attenuation` follows the source filtration proof,
not a separate continuum Taylor approximation:

- `YM.MultiNext.SignedSource.Mom.wiped` (`PMOM.lean`), `.formal_null`
  (`Mom.lean`), `.covers` (`Routes.lean`), `.along` (`Channel.lean`);
  `YM.MultiNext.SignedSource.Broadcast.channel` (`Stereo.lean`),
  `YM.MultiNext.SignedSource.Averaging.locale` and `.sheet0` (`Averaging.lean`),
  `YM.MultiNext.SignedSource.Mediator.attenuation` (`Mediator.lean`).
- `YM.MultiNext.SignedSource.Newt.piece`, `.ix`, `.currency` (`Newt.lean`),
  `.localized`, `.component` (`Newtown.lean`), `.capital` (`TownHall.lean`),
  `.canal` (`NewPromise.lean`), `.straps` (`Operator.lean`), `.spatial` and
  `.positions` (`Crossing.lean`). All these paths are under
  `Lean/YM/MultiNext/SIGNED_SOURCE_CONTINUATION/`.
- `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Peak.homeAL`, `.cradle` (`Peak/Supple.lean`),
  `.spoke`, `.spectrum`, `.facet` (`Peak/Rays.lean`) under
  `Lean/YM/PhysicalNext/RG_NEXT_COMPLETE_REPEATABLE_NONLINEAR_STEP/`.

The expanded proof keeps centered screening, the torus side≥2 condition,
radial-plus-gradient triangular surjection, weighted Taylor polarization,
nonlinear filtration degree loss, and the signed Newton recurrence. The
arbitrary anchor convolution uses factor3 for parent/residue carry. Its
before-block-factor constants do not purport to close the nonlinear display
and Gaussian integration; those are the next application. Independent agent
pass: 7419f0c201bfdd11504401b83246f16b51432f72d35e2ff45520a626640bf1b3.
Source text was inspected, no Lean replay was run.


## Reference attenuation and trace weights

`sec:principal-reference-attenuation` applies the polynomial decomposition
to the actual reference mean, local display and Gaussian integration.
Source paths under `Lean/YM/PhysicalNext/V9_JOINT_ENDPOINT_LOAD/Heir/`:
Dissent (mean tangent), Chorus/Recite (absolute and relative displays),
Panes/Reprise (bondwise winding-support overture), Hymn (Silences cutoff).
Under `Lean/YM/PhysicalNext/RG_NEXT_COMPLETE_REPEATABLE_NONLINEAR_STEP/Peak/`:
Drums.wind/creek, Tansy.tinyBill/huge, Rope and Citrus (moment absorption
and support conversion). The first tangent estimate is a separately reviewed
normal-equation rearrangement of the same row/path/window input. It retains
the exact normalized matrix chord health and same Gaussian coordinates.
Independent bounded pass: 4c379ef574d8d7eb26dbdd9452efeafb230344732afd4a7397c5c5f25e6ab692.

`trace-weighted-estimates.tex` and its companion evidence record the exact
AgeK-weighted scalar estimates and selected ultrafilter transport. Independent
pass: addd9f723d15f8e23fcac9960fc368d653e04adc13d2e2849a5b41bce84097d6.
This remains conditional on its explicitly named local pricing, transport and
field/chart producers. No whole-proof closure is claimed.

Final editorial requirements (maintainer, chat): after substantive closure,
insert Section 2 outlining main proof steps and verified historical precedents;
add a symbolic index; reorder by mathematical dependency and introduce notation
and concepts before use. These tasks remain pending, not completed.

## Principal and same-history closure work, 22:42 UTC

- `sec:regular-principal-producer` expands
  `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Graces.crowning`,
  `Lean/YM/PhysicalNext/RG_NEXT_COMPLETE_REPEATABLE_NONLINEAR_STEP/Graces/Momentum.lean`,
  with `Crowns.startsG/aspirations`. Short/long fine supports use the actual
  reference estimates; coarse supports beyond B use the retained finite-upper-
  exponent multiplier times exp(-B/2). Independent pass b4ddc75cc70e76f38200ecacf8f341179164ac3543049e6870c8601aa16acfe9.
- `sec:primary-calibration-producer` follows `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Cub`
  Arcs.imperfect, Quartz.hues, Dolphin.gasket, Opals.garnets, Central.anthem,
  Impact.translate, Finery.terra, Pieces.starlight, Guided.noted, Chant.logos
  in the same nonlinear-step path; `YM.Planned.PrimaryIntegral295`
  Tones.columnPrice, Oval.sticker, Ramble.billFor (Reaches.lean),
  Postcards.replicate/measured, PPX.Seal.revealed (East.lean), and
  Circlet.Rebel.tallyS/Forest.pride, MergeProof.Mount.budgetCard/Rocky.primaryCard.
  The heading's exact four-factor matrix and physical column cancellation are
  explicit. Independent bounded pass 5aecbeed1b39b51b45a7c51cf6637d8bc922fad033bcf99c90f2a718cb0b8d5b.
- `sec:quadratic-lattice-symmetry` proves the `Bid.Sworn` property identified
  by new blueprint PR30, from `YM.Next.Free.pink_row`, `rotations_d`,
  `face_bill`, `apply_bill`, `sworn_metric` in
  `Lean/YM/Next/FREE_KERNELS/{Pulled,Signed}.lean`. Definitions also inspected
  in Feed.lean (Train.D_signed), Heart.lean (pulse_sources, pulse_zero), and
  `Lean/YM/Bid/Station.lean` (pulled, Sworn). The formula is restricted to the
  real Brillouin cube away from zero; the zero symbol is the identity.
  Bounded review passed subject to that applied precision, final snapshot

- Phase quantitative producer expanded with the actual finite interpolation
  and same-run Cauchy consumer. Bounded conditional pass 28854a8e7921171de3dae7b99cc0caecb735d09c3475cbf6fdb283b253c65571;

  Exact remaining branch confluence/credit, pond/geometry, served transfer,
  fixed-rung Cauchy, and compact Lipschitz hypotheses remain recorded.
- The weighted rank-one linear algebra lemma was moved verbatim from the
  held calibration candidate into the weighted chapter to resolve its
  dependency without integrating the unproved free-rank claims. Final local
  display reflow is 0b62a6669dac67226f1679c16c5e7e84a304a5c4409ffcf1acc5847aa0488c34.

The same-history finite-menu handoff is drafted separately and awaiting review.
A fresh independent closure audit is distinguishing genuine producer gaps from
obsolete conditional interfaces. The nonlinear FullPaths/one-loop construction
is a genuine gap: `Stationary.geared` and `FullPlanned.pouring` supply bounds,
Critical/Guessed, ClassicalMatch, the alpha drift and determinant comparison;
the existing linear horizon does not establish them. The limits author now
owns that disjoint producer expansion. The lattice author owns actual trace
free-rank classification, probe arithmetic, receiver/calibration and local charge
production. No full-existence or human-acceptance claim is made.


### 2026-11-11 22:53 UTC: exact heading and three-port history join

At upstream source pin `3456e5e75cf8d4cd558955a5c7638fba2d68f464`,
`heading-history-handoff.tex` follows Carrier `Headroom.pilot_components`,
`Bijets.status/origin_money/pure_moment`, `Paint.axes_eq/field_pure`,
`Unload.pure_alloc`, `RollFilm.deliver/accepts_V`, then Film
`Stain.waffle/stamps/imprint/print_later`, `HighTable.upper_end`,
`Ledger.preBill`, and PPX `East.toll/Seal.donne`. These files are all in
`Lean/YM/Planned/PRIMARY_INTEGRAL_295/`. The nonprincipal analytic alias
has the full vanishing factor of order j, not merely value zero. Exact
polynomial reproduction and pre-length tensor prices are proved in prose.
The spatial and amplitude grades remain distinct.

The finite triangular inverse proof is `YM.Push.Local.Leading.cost/bijective/core`
in `Lean/YM/Push/LOCAL_SPLITTING/Leading.lean`. The common density, input
exponential/profile and output-profile identities follow `MergeProof/Chalet.grow`,
`Thimble.cloudDrop/thunder`, `Rosin.jewelCard`, `Basal.basalCard`,
`Beacon.heavyK`, then `Crowding.clocksHere` and `Escarp.Bandage.chorus`.
The exact interface is `Wallet.Coupon/Stampede`, followed by `Largo.Tune`.
Canonical coordinate axes are literally `Pi.single i 1` in
`Extra/SOURCE_HISTORIES/Sizes.lean`; the nonunit condition and core weights
are retained. Forced fine normalization is sqrt(forcedAllowance(m+1)); the
output remainder uses sqrt(forcedAllowance(m)), whereas the input Tale
budget remains twice the unnormalized fine mass.

Shared background index inspected; these finite algebra, Fourier-moment,
polarization and finite-sum joins are supplied directly, with no new
literature shortcut claimed. Stronger independent agent reviewed final
hash `9370266cbfc61ce33dc4bf85d7fa8f127485e0d73e9d30684b3d68ba33f2df10`.
This closes the local common-coupon/heading join relative to retained funded
Spring, slots, representation equalities and paid schedule. It does not
prove the nonlinear FullPaths producer.

Finite-menu handoff final hash `8774dfbf1b6a1e802d15c57107c43c5c404f7cda831527bc1f59d54398585249`
adds the reviewer's explicit retained-slot/representation qualification to
passed `2c5d4b97...`. Source route is Garden.field/Daisy.Corral then
Tanger.Many.ripe and Wax.Bandage.paneer. Local trace pairing and repaired
local charge now integrated at their independent reviewed hashes; their
analytic producer boundaries remain explicit in adjacent evidence files.


### 2026-11-11 23:15 UTC: fixed-scale and local comparison mechanisms

At the unchanged upstream pin, four new chapters give the conditional
fixed-scale convergence mechanisms, with independent stronger-agent bounded
reviews; no global proof-completion or human acceptance is asserted.

- `fixed-rung-convergence.tex`: source `YM.FullVolume` graph comparison in

  evaluation in `Fields/Capital`, `Basin`, `Ivy`, `Timber`, `Cement`, `Cowl`,
  `Till`, `Peat`, `Inlay`, `Lofts`, `Pond`; normalized finite census in
  `Gables/Master` and `Pole`. Canonical strict-width summability uses
  `FullVolume/Canvas/Angles`. Actual arrays are Cauchy; no unjustified
  completeness of their seminormed space is claimed. Fixed input one-step
  stability and background convergence are retained. Reviewed SHA

  through `FullVolume/Artes/Gears`, `Cruise`, `Lagoon`, `Letters`, `Events`. The triangular
  stationary Taylor identities, extended-input extrapolation and compactness
  comparison are proved. Arbitrary 64-fold input availability, all-period
  selected representatives and horizon convergence remain explicit inputs.

The explicit Gaussian comparison and finite head/tail arguments use the
existing manuscript's proved estimates. No new literature shortcut is claimed.
Lean compilation and axiom replay were not run for these prose additions.
The actual coupled background activity/coupling trajectory is the next

### Broader nonlinear blueprint correction, 2026-11-11

Read PR #30 at ba33d36fe767e5068d9d02d4dd13ff80ce47a3be and its author's
correction comment 6808850066. This is navigation evidence, not independent
mathematical acceptance. Contrary to an earlier graph summary, the four
Contract1 anchors do not alone produce `Roof.Sheltered` and `WorksIn`.
Additional producers are `Brim.pressings`, `March.takeover` / `Armada.ensemble`
via `Height.beneath` / `haste`, `Height.season`, and `Roof.honey` via
`Boulevard.emits`, `Yearling.brine` / `batten` / `sterling`, `Roof.ensures`,
and `Pane.school`. These require matching against the local analytic chapters;
they are not counted as closed from the earlier anchors. The source revision
remains 3456e5e75cf8d4cd558955a5c7638fba2d68f464. `Yearling.sterling` reaches
`Utopia.whittle` on the corrected graph. `Return.earnings` is already used in
`Rain.glazing` through its Gaussian push supplier. No upstream source changed.

### Real parameter interpolation, draft evidence

Read `YM/FullVolume/Ray/{Veer,Parade,Glimpse,White}.lean`: the local argument
follows `YM.FullVolume.Ray.Fold.landing`, `Fold.scores`, `measured`, `pale`,
and `faded`. Read the immediate Sector interfaces Hinge/Count/Post/Fizz and
subsequent Gift/Aster/Pith/Frail/Jac/Clout/Ruins plus Sym/Chill. The new chapter
`real-coupling-interpolation.tex` proves the coefficient-algebra version of the
far-real-node interpolation, exact signed exponent domination, polynomial
jet factorization, local Gaussian density ratio, and the small-amplitude
log/interpolation/exponential argument. Shared literature index contains no
applicable entry; these elementary finite interpolation and chain-rule steps
are proved directly. Local real jet and support estimates remain inputs;
no whole broad-price production claim yet. No Lean command was run.


### Broad sector parameter production, 2026-11-11

Integrated the independently checked `real-coupling-interpolation.tex`
(d956958055a2acb0596fbfc29c8c2f1de26210c5b2fcaa6b365024481c3a805d) and
`sector-analytic-prices.tex`
(af27aea208c8ed80d25737eed1e1450b6565de3c9b4c516bdf5e669bbb72659f).
The latter follows `YM.ConnectedActivityE6.Empire` Sector declarations
`Lyre.loglift`, `hatched`, `alerts` (Grant), `shows`, `crown` (Reign),
`Margin.painter`, `Lyre.fares` (Husks), `Lyre.sworn` (Fruit), `promotes`
(Sleet), `taste`/`purchases` (Gift), `grill`/`tour` (Aster),
`edition`/`hailed` (Pith), `Tune.sweetly` (Frail), `stays` (Jac),
`clout` (Clout), `candidates` (Ruins), all under `YM/FullVolume/Sector/`.
Exact primitive repricing exponent -55/128 is below the enlarged -2/5 target;
rooted sector ordinary price is betaFine^-3/8 and the forced coefficient
majorant retains exp(-mark) times 2*prismD, prismD=40*overture.
The common real-sector/compensated local inputs remain explicit. The subsequent
five-period localization and projection pricing are separate review candidates.

### Nonlinear singleton and five-period projection checkpoint (2026-11-11)

Source revision remains `3456e5e75cf8d4cd558955a5c7638fba2d68f464`. Parent inspected `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Prism.arrows`, `.high`, `.low` in `Lean/YM/PhysicalNext/RG_NEXT_COMPLETE_REPEATABLE_NONLINEAR_STEP/Prism/Space.lean`, `.trellis` in `Prism/Brass.lean`, `Brim.royaltyB` in `Brim/Lode.lean`, `Brim.round` in `Brim/Found.lean`, and `Brim.pressings`, `.landing`, `.Houses` in `Brim/Level.lean`. The nonlinear-singleton-inheritance chapter proves fixed-insertion exponential cancellation, Gaussian tail comparison, reference L^-5 per occurrence and L^4 anchor aggregation. Its final ef92dad1491eec872e3ed1733d1cfc8d2f9c4e30934f68c725ad929851842458 passed independent agent review. The remainder derivative assertion retains cover(Y)≤B; global regularity uses Captain. Actual path/Plays/regularity hypotheses remain prerequisites. Heir.Lute.issued and Release.preprices/compressed (`Lean/YM/PhysicalNext/V9_JOINT_ENDPOINT_LOAD/Heir/Fusion.lean`), Release.chorus/spread (`Heir/Choirs.lean`) match the reference integration and anchor calculation. The proof reuses the previous comparison and reference-attenuation chapters, not a new independent argument.

Five-period-localization final 9c3622d6fa3adfe3ff3b34aecb22d124bf7e82dd5e7807425518d88937473d36 and projected-parameter-prices final mathematical 1704069b172d93fc1e7567a3bc9be755d8c3479de89076a39cc615ef3a4c77fc passed independent bounded review.

### Degree gain and row price (2026-11-11)

Parent inspected `YM.ConnectedActivityE6.Raw.extraA`, `.inherit_multi` in `Lean/YM/PhysicalNext/RG_NEXT_COMPLETE_REPEATABLE_NONLINEAR_STEP/Census/Typhos.lean`; `Silica.Clutch.hearthGrades` in Grades, `.rushPrices` in Rush, `Silica.Utopia.twinkles` and `.Heavy` in Horns, `Blaze.March.takeover` in Mettle. Graded optional activity and packet suppliers are combined on the same Cash; primitive data remain input. `YM.PhysicalNext.Repeat.Height.strikes`, `.stable` in Census/Widow, `.completed` in Census/Revenue, `.cruising`/`.highPay` in Height/Highway, `.season` in Height/Hip, `.sailing`/`.beneath`/`.haste` in Census/Coffer give two successive tree budgets, occurrence-plus-extra degree, marked/long-footprint gain D^3, forecast payment and finite schedule selection. `YM.ConnectedActivityE6.Blaze.March.Armada.ensemble` in `Lean/YM/AnalyticNext/CONNECTED_ACTIVITY_JETS_E6/Armada.lean` supplies the old unstrengthened budget from exact target rate/expense slack. Parent high-degree-cluster-prices final 0c3ae21dbdd5856a684c06a4b8ebed556b3c20eaf5c5783eaa47141f5c98df73 passed independent bounded review.

These prove selected bridge derivatives, actual gauge identity, weighted inverse strips, selected response-to-kinetic triple prices, nuclear core/rank determinant comparison, Haar/thermal identity and contact leading-term cancellation, and preservation of the fine pole quadratic coefficient. Actual incoming/outgoing matching, selected stationary graph and metric premises remain explicit. The annulus face suppliers and same-history nonlinear funding/continuation have not been globally closed. No fresh Lean build/axiom replay.

Their individual evidence files give the source crosswalk. Layout-only line breaks in annulus-recording-yield and trace-local-rate-selection; corrected physical-reset-reorganization reference from section to subsection label. Whole-proof closure remains incomplete; review approvals remain null.

### Three scalar trace prices, 2026-11-12 06:49 UTC
Imported independently checked `trace-medal-prices.tex` at 7448bc6578c66a5b5183dedc3a46e5d72a470af46692b693d05b86c91065ad60 with same-stem evidence. Scope is cloud, forced-gas and tuition scalar estimates only; no response-record construction is inferred. Independent bounded review is in reviews/draft-review.md. Machine review fields remain null.

### Terminal marked birth and same-history centered service, 2026-11-12 06:52 UTC
Integrated terminal-marked-construction at 8ee1de534ce04b5d0c0dd8fd354e13e5367ecc05e4433e25cbfaf646df8fc0d7 and selected-centered-service at ea1ccdec549ae7fbd2335afa6295654f3619c24c4f6872afdffc9fec775b440e after independent bounded review. Same-stem evidence records sources and scope. The marked terminal construction supplies reserved slots, bad-stencil supplement, exact attachment bijection and forced profile, motion covariance and the separate uniform birth fee. The selected service retains the strengthened rodB arc and finite support/inventory wing. This closes this centered binding relative to its cited analytic purchases; stronger public portfolio/rank/OPE/trace assembly remains outstanding. Machine review fields remain null.

### Same-data annulus and trace insertion, 2026-11-12 06:54 UTC
Integrated independently checked annulus-same-data-binding at 095be0354ac9e6f715fb18ded93d62dce4201427195a4685a04d1f2f0ce613ba and trace-eve-producer at 0bc1e4da3c975b52aa666b8ea6d4ddb6e13e0d8dea382b36e6a3dfaec3866e0b, with same-stem evidence. The annulus unit identifies the same combined stationary/Wilson response in the finite recording and radial estimate. Eve uses the canonical principal Gaussian comparison on its exact insertion/read-set/chart data, alongside proved finite billing. Both are local reviewed draft applications; remaining global all-grade comparison, portfolio and trace-scale suppliers remain distinct.

## 2026-11-12: joint reader, healthy launch and physical stress integration

Integrated the exact bounded-reviewed snapshots: all-arity-reader-gaussian-model 7e718451, trace-scribe-producer 207d6605, marked-healthy-cumulant-launch d82d6be0. Source crosswalks are in the matching evidence files; review fingerprints in reviews/draft-review.md. Joint reader keeps quantitative sight, guard and field inputs; physical stress keeps sensor and branch inputs assigned to #33/#34. Healthy launch proves the cochain/transport/cumulant comparison from its stated paid input, not the original strong-history Tone producer. No whole-proof closure or human acceptance.


2026-11-12 09:00 UTC: Integrated actual-mixed-marked-compiler (a082a48ada2824588270987ed27e303d9ca247cb7525f608359a68b2654eb020), independently parent-reviewed because authored by the independent reviewer; the report is reviews/parent-mixed-compiler-review.md. It retains genuine-P BodyGrant versus white-P ReturnTrip on the same corrected alphabet, connected covers and distinct upper/lower tail purchases. Actual body/all-hole analytical purchases remain incoming. Integrated actual-marked-portfolio-calibration at layout fingerprint 94a92748ef87edf19c4810cc6bb8c90c2cec2ef7b498eceb6132120a0dcf457f, with independent editorial carry confirmed. Original-history Scrim/Cream binding was still incoming at integration and is now assigned separately. The 734-page build and sampled rendering passed; no full-proof or accepted-status claim.


## 2026-11-12 09:44 UTC integration

Integrated bounded independently checked actual-reader-tree-covariance,
original-history-portfolio-attachment, actual-harvested-owner-energy and
actual-corrected-body-compiler. Their adjacent evidence files give the exact
source declarations and retained hypotheses. Body retains all-Matched Pupil,
actual white/all-hole and quantitative source purchases. Owner energy supplies
its changed-threshold and harvested-ceiling join under the actual canonical
seed/chart/branch conditions; it does not prove Pupil. Public attachment follows
the native preselected postnumeric route on one retained run, not Roll/Novena.

Dawn selection and local Gaussian-price candidates have bounded conditional
passes but remain outside the PDF until their exact small-window/guard/short-cover
inputs are integrated. This is not complete-proof certification. Source main has
not changed since the previous blueprint check. See current CHECKPOINT and
USAGE-HANDOFF for active assignments and the maintainer's stop condition.

## 12 November, 10:21 UTC — actual reader, rank and relay checkpoint

Integrated actual-reader-small-window-bridge and actual-reader-local-gaussian-prices;
actual-rank-purchases; actual-equation-kernel-relay; actual-insertion-derivative-relay;
public-run-binding. Their adjacent evidence files give the exact pinned declarations,
normalizations and retained hypotheses. The independent agent recorded bounded
source and mathematical passes, including explicit margins, two-floor resolvent,
common readout, all-spectator planting, derivative shift purchase and actual native
selector witness retention. Finite-rank-kernel-transport now explicitly invokes
the source Lease.take spectator bridge; parent review records that consumer repair.
The manuscripts remain drafts, with machine review fields unset. Actual global
weighted row/source production, all-Matched Pupil, short covariance, guarded reader,
external trace scopes and global dependency closure remain in progress.
## 2026-11-12 10:45 UTC — refreshed nonlinear notes and actual stress frontier

Read the updated nonlinear and rank interface notes from upstream main
`5535cc1579029c69155b0d0a89c13b819bf0f5f1`. These notes are navigation evidence;
the Lean pin remains `3456e5e75cf8d4cd558955a5c7638fba2d68f464`.
The maintainer merged PR #35 at `660cada`; continued work is draft PR #36.

The nonlinear note's additional suppliers have the following current canonical
homes, at their explicitly retained hypotheses:

| Source obligation | Canonical exposition/evidence |
| --- | --- |
| `Brim.pressings` beyond the four headline estimates | `nonlinear-singleton-inheritance.tex`; earlier bounded source review recorded above |
| `Height.season`, `Height.beneath/haste`, `March.takeover`, `Armada.ensemble` | `high-degree-cluster-prices.tex`, including the common-field Cauchy--Schwarz bridge; graded component suppliers remain explicit |
| `Boulevard.emits` and the full `Portaged` clauses | `small-field-budget-selection.tex` plus `healthy-boundary-jets.tex`; `stationary-small-field-evidence.md` |
| `Yearling.brine/batten/sterling` | `parameter-comparison-suppliers.tex`, `finite-volume-parameter-continuity.tex`, `parameter-continuity-evidence.md` |
| `Roof.ensures` | `small-field-budget-selection.tex` and the actual return in `selected-nonlinear-offering.tex` |
| `Pane.school` / `Morning` | `pure-action-small-field.tex`, `uniform-stationary-chart.tex`, `stationary-action-prices.tex`, and their actual auxiliary application in `selected-nonlinear-offering.tex` |
| `Roof.honey` / `WorksIn` simultaneous purchase | `common-funded-history.tex`; the four constituent estimates above are needed separately |

This pass directly reread `Roof/Honey.lean`, `Boulevard/Dawn.lean`, and
`Pane/Calls.lean` under `Lean/YM/PhysicalNext/RG_NEXT_COMPLETE_REPEATABLE_NONLINEAR_STEP/`,
as well as the cited evidence and the relevant canonical prose. `WorksIn`
has chip/year/terms/plaza, not just `Sheltered`; `Pane.Morning` is an
all-auxiliary-tube statement retaining the actual critical branch, classical
match, finite quadratic bound, path bounds and Cash. `Pane.shouts` invokes
the actual uniform stationary graph and `Shellac.erudite`; these inputs are
not obtained from a delay maximum alone. The updated note therefore does
not justify suppressing those retained hypotheses. No new global dependency
closure certificate is claimed by this correspondence table.

The rank note revealed a genuine additional native dependency: `Run.extractible17`
constructs `Aroma R.family` before `Acme.readyA`, which needs the shrinking-shell
annular field representation. This is assigned to the isolated lattice agent.
The parent drafted the separate exact `Focus/Local/Limit` derivative-convergence,
compact-jet and coherent-sign normalization join; its final `f4c1cebb58e543351f2b59c37a9aedbc70ce4362fb85827e2cffedc428ba1be9`
passed bounded independent review. The exact free Maxwell collar Ward producer
was also found missing and is now a separate review candidate. These are on
the actual native path, not the alternate `SharpGram` witness.

Integrated bounded-reviewed global row prices `c44170404157e5315b4785f2d64bc33ae0afbabfbe0511ccae5b7cfac0cded7c`
and all-period short covariance `3482d873b406659f9cd5686eccdb76ef280c7f77007980c7193bbc472c364664`.
Their adjacent evidence files state the exact global/local and all-period
quantifiers and remaining inputs. No Lean source changes, fresh Lean build
or axiom replay were performed. Whole-proof and human acceptance remain open.

The free Maxwell collar Ward producer is now integrated at TeX fingerprint
`66d6a6671deec2afa2f09e52f2164f6f3475090fc5a01147dea4db1bcb10e27a`
and evidence fingerprint
`91b9529dfe0be655b8251b7c554956c85c94f29fd705a0a2328df69f1251b16a`.
Its bounded independent pass checks regulator mass/sign, the three Wick-pair
locations, normalized jets, and the same native Maxwell witness. This does not
supply the physical annular representation or its propagation to integrated
physical symmetry actions; the endpoint audit identifies those separately.

## 2026-11-12 11:10 UTC — actual reader and phase/symmetry joins

Integrated guarded curvature at c740f410 (layout-only carry from f2fc9a53),
uniform Dawn selection at its previously reviewed fingerprint, all-Matched
Pupil at 368bd695, slab-copy bounds at 3221838d, corrected phase-detector
moments at 5c9df3d7 (q in N clarified), and angular actions at c244c72a.
Adjacent evidence and independent review logs record exact source scope.
Dawn's same-history covariance binding was independently checked; guard
now supplies its power-small mask input. Exact sharper reserve wording
remains scoped in guard rather than claimed as a different estimate.

Slab production proves Bench/AllCopy from CellHyp with two-scale exterior
group roots and replica-independent constants. Detector moments prove
B15–B18/Funds from the actual corrected trial polynomials and retain the
real-grid reflected-word identity. Angular actions prove the same-Q
relative-Casimir correction, actual rotation laws and normalized Haar
stress average; physical Ward propagation and its same-Track comparisons
remain explicit inputs. The held physical-annulus draft is not integrated.
These bounded passes do not certify global closure or human acceptance.

## 2026-11-12 11:35 UTC — common compiler, actual grids and analytic continuation

Integrated actual-phase-grid-approximants (5f2b6050), same-data local compiler
(9e22856e), and physical Ward extreme-point analyticity (fe34ec19, display-only
reflow to 685077ff). Their adjacent evidence maps exact pinned declarations.
The first supplies actual Origin and coherent real four-pair grids from the
retained paid Makes/Scrim/Tabs/CellHyp. The compiler matches C1–C8 to one tuple,
including atomic-list weighted matrix rates, a torus-uniform neighborhood gap,
retimed interval quantifiers, genuine BodyGrant and white Veins on one alphabet.
Actual path/clip/Alongside, inherited law and Tissue remain explicit inputs.
The analytic bridge supplies the extreme-segment analytic rows from OS heat
evolution, all-grade collinear Ward and commutation; the Hilbert factorial
estimate closes the smooth-jet-to-analyticity step. Physical Ward propagation
and actual shell production remain separate. No global closure is asserted.

Fetched main at 454fcbb: maintainer merged PR36; no new source pin or additional
blueprint notes since 5535cc1. Live issues26/33/34 rechecked; scopes unchanged.


## 12 November: annulus and spectral Ward suppliers

New canonical sections are actual-stress-annulus, physical-ward-packet-prices
and physical-ward-stress-cone, with adjacent evidence files and bounded exact
review records in reviews/draft-review.md. The annulus remains conditional on
the actual ShellNode producer. The cone now supplies the seven spectral errors
and exponent delta+4a, including -395, without presupposing full rotations.
`endpoint-closure-ledger.md` records inspected public assembly identities and
remaining same-data obligations. It is an author audit, not whole-proof closure.


## 12 November: Ward, phase inheritance and free internal/collision inputs

Imported physical Ward propagation941dfa8 (conditional on the explicit free
polar classifier), free internal Ward erasure be439656, and all-character compact
Ward inheritance ba6a0498. Exact evidence records and independent bounded passes
are adjacent/in reviews. Internal erasure preserves the same finite capacity,
uses the grade-four House pairing only there, and propagates with actual
rotational flux and strict positivity. Every-character inheritance uses a bounded
linear extension, not an unproved positive or multiplicative extension. Mixed and
selected continuations remain separate; UniqueHeat is only selected.

The pole-separation chapter9a1cc07b supplies the substantive collision residue
argument found missing in the held free classifier: radial Laplacian clearing,
finite product-pole peeling, all four two-probe Wick placements, and exact
same-capacity circulation nullity. It has a bounded independent pass and does
not supply the remaining generic determinant, filtration and charge-classifier
arguments. No changed mathematical scope or stronger public endpoint is claimed.


The phase-retention join now explicitly proves original-null inclusion at every
character by dense whole-slab matrix elements, before using the no-new-null
finite detector. Phase-regularity ca8cf386 and phase-fields ae206df6, with
phase-null-inheritance-evidence473635ef, passed bounded independent review.
The same-trial spanning application is now linked to canonical rank and moment
producers; no new rank estimate or arbitrary table replacement is introduced.

Free radial flux6f3b7f68/evidence4014691c also has a bounded independent pass.
It supplies the exact weighted Euler charge −(j+2) on jet probes using the
same stress as the translation/rotation identities, including the regulated
trace cancellation and all Wick contraction placements. This previously
implicit input is needed by the held quiet-charge classifier.

## Actual shell-node producer (12 November checkpoint)

`manuscript/existence/actual-stress-shell-nodes.tex` supplies the shell-specific
finite two-channel composition, rates, quota and root estimates under explicit
same-history service receipts. See `actual-stress-shell-nodes-evidence.md` and
the exact bounded independent review hashes. It precedes the conditional annular
consumer. This does not discharge the global selected-history binding. The
separate `lattice-history-closure-refresh.md` narrows that outstanding audit.

## Free external detector, quiet charges and finite collinear tests

The canonical `physical-ward-free-classification.tex` now supplies the finite
external-capacity detector, quiet polar-vector classification and finite
collinear test selection at its exact stated grades and covariance hypotheses.
See its evidence and the independent review logs. The general cross-order
pairing separation and its applications have an additional independent parent
review in `reviews/classifier-ranging-parent-review.md`. The selected interacting
application retains its own common-data and convergence obligations; this free
result does not discharge the complete existence argument.

## Selected-course binding, narrowly scoped

`selected-course-binding.tex` proves the binding on the literal selected family
from Run.bought and generic monotonicity of paid schedules, including the full
plateau interval and global period condition. It does not recover an internal
franchise receipt for an already fixed run. See its source evidence and exact
independent review; the next C12/C13 audit should compare the actual exported
Chateau rated/warrant/market outputs with the required local consumer inputs,
rather than automatically invent a new raw-receipt or Launch obligation.
