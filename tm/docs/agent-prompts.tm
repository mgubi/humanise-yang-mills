  <ym-title|Instructions to give your agent><label|instructions-to-give-your-agent>

  Replace the bracketed fields. Give the agent a fresh clone or worktree,
  access to the task issue, and an explicit compute/time budget. These
  prompts work without assuming a particular agent product or multi-agent
  feature.

  Authenticate through your own GitHub account before starting; see the
  <hlink|access guide|access.tm>. Never include a token in these prompts.
  Public contributors normally work in a fork without collaborator access to
  the main repo.

  <section|Contribute one task><label|contribute-one-task>

  <\verbatim-code>
    Help with https://github.com/hairer/humanise-yang-mills.

    Read README.md, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and the linked coordination
    and proof

    standards. My GitHub account is [ACCOUNT]; your unique session is
    [SESSION].

    Your budget is [TIME/COMPUTE LIMIT].

    \;

    Inspect the live issues and open PRs. Work on [ISSUE URL], or recommend
    one small

    ready task suited to your capabilities if I have not specified an issue.
    Check

    for existing work before proposing anything new.

    \;

    You may publish a bounded task when needed, post self-claims, renewals,
    progress,

    questions and handoffs under my account, and open a draft PR. Follow

    docs/coordination.md: check overlap, post CLAIM with scope/session/UTC
    expiry,

    then re-read the live discussion before starting. No manual approval is
    needed.

    If GitHub is unavailable, prepare the comment for me to post and relay
    the live

    conflict check. A local Bots file or unassigned issue is not a claim.

    \;

    After recording and checking the claim, use an isolated branch/worktree.
    Read only the relevant

    source and expand through dependencies as needed. Preserve Lean/. Produce
    the

    agreed deliverable with precise source citations, mathematical reasoning,
    and

    explicit uncertainties. Write mathematical text directly in manuscript
    LaTeX;

    use the proof-unit template for linked metadata and correspondence, not a
    second

    copy of the proof. State outstanding prerequisite interfaces explicitly.

    \;

    Aim for a research monograph with detailed proofs. Search the shared
    literature

    notes and original sources before developing a proof; prefer an
    applicable existing

    result with a precise citation. Check its hypotheses here, and prove any
    extra

    step or variant. Give detailed arguments for substantive steps not
    supplied by

    references. An outline of the ideas is insufficient. Standard machinery
    may be

    implemented from scratch in Lean; this does not require translating its
    proof.

    Keep formal scaffolding out of the manuscript and source crosswalks in
    the blueprint.

    \;

    Use issue comments for live coordination and PR comments for review.
    Preserve

    useful durable discoveries in the proof unit or a concise Bots/ note.
    Request

    new tasks for out-of-scope work. Stop at claim expiry or budget
    exhaustion and

    leave a handoff; do not silently abandon unfinished work.

    \;

    Run applicable checks and report the commands actually run. Submit one
    focused

    PR linked to the task, report what remains unverified, and request
    independent

    review. Do not merge, publish, or approve your own contribution.
  </verbatim-code>

  <section|Review an existing unit><label|review-an-existing-unit>

  <\verbatim-code>
    Review [UNIT ID / PR URL] for [LEAN CORRESPONDENCE / MATHEMATICAL
    VALIDITY].

    Read AGENTS.md, docs/proof-standard.md, the task discussion, and
    templates/review.md.

    I authorise task-related GitHub comments and a review submission.
    Self-claim the

    review task after overlap checks; use session [SESSION] and budget
    [LIMIT].

    \;

    Check the pinned source and the actual argument independently. Do not
    rely on the

    author's confidence or another agent's approval. Identify concrete
    errors, missing

    hypotheses, unsupported steps, and unresolved dependencies. Separate
    definite

    findings from questions. Record the exact content fingerprint you
    inspected.

    \;

    Check that substantive steps have detailed proofs or verified, applicable
    literature

    references. Inspect the cited statements and their hypotheses. Look for
    existing

    results that could replace unnecessary rederivations, and for gaps
    disguised as

    standard facts. Do not demand prose for helpers that serve only formal
    implementation.

    \;

    Produce a review report with evidence and required changes. Do not
    silently rewrite

    the author's work or mark the unit accepted. A human reviewer must take

    responsibility for acceptance. Leave a concise handoff on the review
    issue.
  </verbatim-code>

  <section|Coordinate a wave of work><label|coordinate-a-wave-of-work>

  <\verbatim-code>
    Help me coordinate [AREA] in humanise-yang-mills. Read the repository
    instructions,

    the source audit, the current proof map, and the live issues and PRs. I
    authorise

    you to create and update task issues and post coordination comments
    within this

    area. Contributors self-claim without manual grants; help resolve
    conflicts and

    organize review. Do not merge PRs or publish mathematical conclusions.

    \;

    Propose a small set of bounded tasks with exact interfaces, declarations,
    output

    paths, prerequisites, and acceptance criteria. Search for overlap first.
    Give

    priority to shared prerequisites and tasks that unblock other
    contributors.

    Reserve shared editorial files separately. Do not guess theorems from
    filenames.

    \;

    Classify mathematical interfaces before assigning prose: prove in detail,
    cite and

    apply, suppress formal scaffolding, or investigate. Search for reusable
    literature

    results and create shared reference notes. Do not distribute one
    translation task

    per Lean helper. The output must give the full mathematical argument at
    research

    monograph level, with detailed proofs for steps not supplied by cited
    results.

    \;

    For your assigned issues, monitor self-claims and UTC expiries, resolve
    accidental

    overlaps, track blockers, and preserve handoffs. Respect existing live
    claims.

    Assign independent review tasks when drafts are ready. Measure useful
    reviewed

    results and unresolved dependencies, not tokens spent or pages generated.

  Codex supports repository instructions in <verbatim|AGENTS.md> and isolated
  Git worktrees; see the official <hlink|instruction
  guide|https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md/> and
  <hlink|worktree guide|https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/worktrees/>.
  For other tools, explicitly include the same repository instructions in the
  prompt.
